/Unit 1

- In older times, the difference between the average incomes of people living in different countries from all over the world was negligible.
- Now, income inequality is the new norm — with the poorest 10% of some countries being richer than the richest 10% of others.

Ways to measure income and living standards:
- GDP per capita
- Disposable income
Both are quantitative measures and exclude qualitative measures such as:
- Quality of physical and social environment
- Amount of free time
- Goods and services provided by the government
- Goods and services produced within the household.
Hence, they are imperfect measures of wellbeing. 

Growth in income
- Growth rate = change in income/original level of income
- Before the Industrial Revolution, living standards did not improve in a sustained way. 
- The improvement of living standards began at different times for different countries, hence leading to income disparity between countries that started earlier and those that started later.

Technology
- In economics, it is a process that takes a set of materials and other inputs (work of people and machines, time, energy, etc.) and creates an output. 
- Structural transformation is the moving away of labour from the agricultural sector of the economy.

The economy and the environment
- Natural resources that were once thought to be unlimited began to be used at astronomical rates due to the Industrial Revolution.
- The emissions of CO2 and other polluting substances has led to climate change due to global warming. 

Capitalism
Includes the institutions of:
- Private property (inputs and outputs)
- Markets
- Firms
Conditions for it to be dynamic:
- Secure private property
- Competitive market
- Firms owned by people delivering high-quality services.

Economics: study of how people interact with each other and their natural surroundings in producing their livelihoods, and how this changes over time.

Economy: part of society, which is part of the biosphere.
