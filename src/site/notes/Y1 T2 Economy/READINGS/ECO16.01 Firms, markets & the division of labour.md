Firm: economic organization in which private owners of capital goods hire and direct labour to produce goods and services for sale on markets to make a profit.
Other types of economic organizations:
- Operated by one person who is the owner and only worker.
- Operated by the owner and employs only unpaid family workers.

Workers who work for salaries
- Regular wage workers: paid on a regular basis.
- Casual wage workers: people employed on a temporary basis. 

6.1 
Division of labour: specialization of producers to carry out different tasks in the process of production. 
Coordinated through:
- Firms
	- Represent concentrated economic power.
- Markets
	- Decentralization of power. 
Herbert Simon's idea of a firm:
- Composed of individuals with conflicting needs and desires.

Firms
- Hierarchy in which some people have power over others. 
- Asymmetry of information within hierarchy: people at lower levels know things that people at higher levels do not. 
- Mini-economy which is centralized. 
Contracts and relationships
- Wage labour contracts: an employee gives the employers the right to direct the employee to work at specific times and perform specific tasks.
- Temporary transfer of authority over employee to employer.

6.2
- Profits of firm legally belong to those who own the firm's assets.
- Owners are called residual claimants because they collect the profits (amount left after paying employees, managers, taxes, suppliers, etc.)
- When ownership and control are separated, managers make decisions with other people's money, creating less incentive to optimize profit.
	- To work around this, owners can structure contracts so that managerial compensation depends on the share price.
	- Or the board of directors can monitor the managers' performance. 

6.3
The profits of a firm depend on:
- Costs of acquiring inputs 
- Output
- Sales revenue earned from selling goods and services.
Contractual incompleteness between employee and employer:
- Does not include how hard and well employees will work
- Does not include length of contract
This leads to employers paying just enough wages to provide some amount of economic rent to employees, to incentivize them to work harder. Hence, paying the minimum possible wage is not the best policy to minimize costs.
When firms pay employees according to their levels of productivity: piece rate payment.

6.4 Employment rents
- Motivations for employees working hard may vary: intrinsic, gratitude for good working conditions, fear of losing employment, sense of responsibility, etc.
- Employment rent: the economic rent a worker receives when the net value of a job exceeds the value of their next best alternative (being unemployed).
	- Makes employees more likely to stay with the firm. 
	- Can threaten to fire the worker (exertion of power by managers/owners over employees).
- Calculating employment rent: 
	- Costs of working: disutility of work, cost of traveling to work daily.
	- Benefits of working: wage income, firm-specific assets, medical insurance, social status. 

6.5 Determinants of employment rent
Need to understand how an employee would evaluate:
- Pay received
- Effort put in
	- Disutility of work depends on this. 

First, must find: net utility of working.
= wage — disutility of effort.
(per day wages)
Total employment rent depends on length of unemployment. 
Total employment = employment rent (per hour) x no. of hours of work lost if job terminated
Unemployment benefits or other sources of income will offset loss. This is called reservation wage. 
- However, they do not last forever and usually have an expiry date. 

6.6 Work and wages: labour discipline model
- Employees can increase the cost of job loss by adding benefits or increasing wages to incentivize employees to work harder.
- At lower rents, effort can be increased easily if wages are increased even slightly. (steeper curve)

6.7 Wages, effort, and profits in the labour discipline model
- Cost per unit of effort = w/e 
- Where MRS (slope of employer's indifference curve/isocost line) = MRT (slope of employee's best response curve/employer's feasible frontier)
Involuntary unemployment
- It will always exist, since employers will always offer slightly higher wages to exercise power over employees by creating economic rent.
- This would cause the number of jobs offered to decrease, since employers also want to reduce costs.

Best response function depends on:
- Utility of items bought using the wage
- Disutility of work
- Probability of getting fired at every effort level
- Reservation wage
Increase of an unemployment spell: reduces reservation wage, increases period of lost work time. Hence, employment rent (both total and per hour) increases.
- Many employees work harder with no change in wages in periods of high unemployment as well. 

6.9 Dual economy
- Reduction in size of the informal sector and increased employment in the capitalist sector = structural transformation of the dual economy.

6.10 Principals and agents: Interactions under incomplete contracts
Why are contracts incomplete?
- Unverifiable information & asymmetry of information
- Time and uncertainty
- Measurement: many goods and services are difficult to measure, and are hence not mentioned in the contract.
- Absence of a judiciary
- Preferences
Principal-agent models
- Principal (employer) wants agent (employee) to work hard, but the agent does not want to.
- Hidden action problem created, since the agent working hard is unverifiable (cannot be enforced by a court) or asymmetric (known to agent but not to principal) information.
