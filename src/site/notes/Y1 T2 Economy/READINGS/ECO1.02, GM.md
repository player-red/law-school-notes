Definition
GDP: market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. 
Excludes: items produced and consumed at home, quality of the environment.
Focuses on GDP as total expenditure.
Calculation: adding up total expenditure/income — difference between the two is called statistical discrepancy.

GDP = C + I + G + NX
Where C = consumption, I = investment, G = government purchases, NX = net exports

Final goods: no further production will take place, sold to consumers. Only final goods are considered for the GDP.
	Exception: when intermediate goods are purchased and added to inventory for use or sale at a later date. When later used or sold, they are subtracted from the GDP.

- Gross National Product (GNP): total income earned by permanent residents/nationals. Includes income earned abroad by residents and excludes income earned by foreigners in the country.
- Net National Product (NNP): total income of a nation's residents minus depreciation. 
	- Depreciation: consumption of fixed capital. 
- National income: total income earned by a nation's residents in producing goods and services.
	- Almost the same as NNP, only differs due to statistical discrepancy.
- Personal income: income received by households and noncorporate businesses. Includes income from holdings of government debt and transfer programs. Excludes retained earnings. Subtracts indirect business taxes, corporate income taxes and contributions for social insurance. 
	- Retained earnings: income that corporations have earned but not paid out to owners.
- Disposable personal income: income left after subtracting personal taxes and nontax payments. 

Consumption
- Spending by households on goods and services, except the purchase of new houses. 
Investment 
- Purchase of goods (capital goods) that will be used in the future to produce more goods and services.
Government Purchases
- Spending on goods and services by all levels of government.
- Includes salaries of civil servants and expenditure on public works.
- Transfer payments such as benefits from social security schemes are not included. 
Net Exports
- Foreign purchases of domestically produced goods minus domestic purchases of foreign goods. 

Real GDP vs Nominal GDP
- If total spending increases, it may be because of the following two reasons: 
	- Economy producing a larger output of goods and services
	- Goods and services being sold at higher prices (inflation)
- In order to measure total quantity rather than reflecting changes in prices, real GDP is used. 
	- It uses fixed prices.

GDP Deflator
- Reflects only change in price levels, unlike nominal (both price and quantity) and real (only quantity).
(Nominal GDP/Real GDP) x 100

Inflation: when the general price levels of an economy rise.
Inflation rate (y2) = {(GDP Deflator y2 - GDP Deflator y1)/GDP Deflator y1} x 100

Criticisms of GDP:
- Says nothing about distribution of income and income inequality
- Does not measure the quality of the environment
- Does not include the goods and services produced and consumed at home.
