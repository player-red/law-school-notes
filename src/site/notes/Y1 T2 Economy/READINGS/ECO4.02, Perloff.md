Costs

To reduce the cost of production, a solution that is both technologically and economically efficient is chosen. 

Nature of Costs
- Explicit costs
	- Calculated by multiplying factor price by the number of units used. 
- Implicit costs
	- Reflect foregone opportunities rather than direct spending. 
- Opportunity/economic costs:
	- Value of the best alternative use of a resource.
	- Both implicit and explicit. 
	- Time is an important resource affected by opportunity cost that is often ignored. 

Determining the opportunity cost of capital
- Capital is a durable good: can be used for years.
- Two considerations:
	- How to allocate the initial purchase cost over time.
	- What to do if the value of the capital changes over time (depreciation or appreciation).
- The two considerations do not matter if the firm rents the capital. 
- Opportunity cost of bought capital = amount earned if rented out to others. 

Sunk cost
- Past expenditure that cannot be recovered. 
- If expenditure on a fixed input is sunk, it is not opportunity cost. 
- In decision-making, firms should ignore sunk cost and use opportunity cost instead. 

Short-run costs
- Total cost = variable cost + fixed cost
	- Fixed cost: does not change with output. Capital goods such as land, machines, etc.
	- Variable cost: changes with output, such as labour and raw materials. 
- Marginal cost
	- Amount by which cost changes if the firm produces one more unit of output. 
	- delta C/delta q OR delta VC/delta q
- Average costs
	- Average fixed cost (AFC)
		- Fixed cost/units of output (F/q)
	- Average variable cost (AVC)
		- Variable cost/units of output (VC/q)
	- Average total cost
		- AFC + AVC OR Total cost/units of output (C/q)

Production function determines the shape of a firm's cost curves. Shows amount of input needed to produce given level of output. 
VC = wL (wage x no of hours of labour)
