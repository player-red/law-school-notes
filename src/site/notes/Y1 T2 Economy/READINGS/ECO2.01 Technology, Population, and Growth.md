[[Y1 T2 Economy/CONCEPTS/Capitalism\|Capitalism]].

Malthus' theory of income: an increase in income per capita would be impossible to sustain. Believed disasters like famine was nature's response to overbreeding. 

Real wages: wages adjusted to represent the real buying power of the wages earned at a particular point in time. 

Building an economic model requires the following steps:
1. A simplified description of the conditions under which people take actions.
2. Describe in simple terms what determines the actions that people take. 
3. Determine how each of their actions affects each other.
4. Determine the outcome of their actions, often an equilibrium. 
5. Study what happens to certain variables when conditions change.
They begin with assumptions about how people behave in order to predict the movements of the economy.

Calculating the cost of production using different technologies
cost = (wage x workers) + (price of material x quantity of materials)

Slope of an isocost (iso=same) line:
-(wage/price)
Isocost lines as equations
c = (w x L) + (p x R)
pR = c - wL
R = (c/p) - (w/p)L

Innovation rent = benefit earned by adopting new technology
- First adopter: entrepreneur
- When everyone uses new technology, no one earns innovation rent - creative destruction. 

Key assumptions made by Malthus:
1. Production is subject to diminishing average product of labour.
	- Diminishing average product of labour: since all other input (other than labour) is fixed, the average product of labour diminishes as the number of labourers increases.
	- When the marginal utility of each labour becomes 0 or negative, it is called surplus labour. 
	- When the population increases, inferior land is brought into cultivation as well. 
2. Population expands if living standards increase beyond a subsistence level of income. 
	- The family stops growing when it reaches equilibrium (subsistence levels, no more can be produced to support all labourers.)
These two assumptions are the reasoning behind the flat part of the hockey stick. 

- Discovery of new technology that creates one-off improvement: increases the productivity of the farm, which increases population. 
	- New equilibrium created. 
	- Larger population, same or decreasing wages. 
	- Malthus' Law: this vicious cycle.
	- Increase in the relative economic position of landowners, since land and resources become more scarce when the population increases. 

Escape from stagnation
- Malthus' assumptions stopped holding true in the following centuries. 
- The simultaneous increase of population and real wages was termed 'escape'.
- Influences on wage:
	- How much is produced: total production greatly increased, reducing scarcity. 
	- Share going to workers: through the increase in bargaining power of workers and supply and demand. 
- Called the 'permanent technological revolution'.
- Increasing agricultural productivity: due to availability of technology and capital. 
- Falling fertility rates: goes against assumption no. 2, that population would increase if living standards increase. 
	- Rise of birth control, improvements in modern medicine, education, women's rights movements ([[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]]).
	- Now, lower birth rates = higher incomes.
	- Since there is no need to have children to increase family output and income.
