Unit 3
- Opportunity cost describes the trade-off that one has to make in order to make decisions. 
	- This is because we are in a state of scarcity, meaning we have limited time and means to achieve our objectives. 

Types of work
- Paid work 
	- Wage work (common in high-income countries)/regular wage/salaried employment
	- Own account work (common in low-income countries)
	- Piece-rate work
	- Casual labour (for daily wages)
- Unpaid work
	- Work performed at home/care work
		- Vital for reproduction of human society, most often performed by women ([[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]], [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]])
		- Burdens women's ability to work for pay
		- Women have lower participation rates in the labour force than men, in most countries.
		- In India, women spent 6 times as much time as men doing unpaid work.

Production function
- number of hours per day spent working -> output produced
	- the more hours added, the more output
- average product = slope = vertical axis/horizontal axis
- marginal product = increase in output from increase in the number of hours by 1 
	- diminishing
	- true marginal product = slope of the tangent to the curve

Preferences
- Depending on the things someone cares about, they decide how to spend their time by calculating opportunity cost. 
- Indifference to two different outcomes: equal satisfaction = same amount of utility. 
- Collection of outcomes that provide the same amount of utility: indifference curve.
	- Slope downward due to trade-offs.
	- Higher indifference curves = higher utility levels
	- Usually smooth, since there are rarely big jumps in utility
	- Do not cross
	- They become flatter as you move to the right
- Marginal rate of substitution: trade-off a person is ==willing== to make between goods, eg. 9rs for an hour of free time. 
	- diminishes.
	- slope of the indifference curve.

Opportunity costs
- If you do A, you cannot do B.
	- Not doing B = opportunity cost.
	- If doing A yields more benefit than doing B, you get economic rent ([[Y1 T2 Economy/READINGS/ECO2.01 Technology, Population, and Growth\|ECO2.01 Technology, Population, and Growth]]).
		- Economic rent = benefit - economic cost
- Economic cost = actual price paid (out of pocket cost) + opportunity cost

Feasible frontier
- Highest income possible to receive, along with the amount of free time wanted.
- All combinations on or inside the frontier are feasible. 
	- By choosing a combination inside the frontier, you give up something that is freely available (ie no opportunity cost).
- Marginal rate of transformation (MRT): quantity of some good that must be (ie ==constrained to make this choice==) sacrificed to obtain 1 additional unit of another good (eg, sacrificing an hour of free time to obtain 7 more rupees).
	- Slope of the feasible frontier.

Decision-making and scarcity
- The further away the indifference curve is from the origin, the higher the utility it provides. 
- In order to balance the feasible frontier and the indifference curve, the point on the indifference curve that is tangential to the feasible frontier must be chosen to maximize utility. 
	- At this point, the MRS and MRT are equal. 
	- This is called a constrained choice problem. 

Hours of work and economic growth
- Keynes suggested that technological improvement would solve the struggle for subsistence and reduce our working hours, while simultaneously increasing our pay. 
- Technological improvements increase productivity for the same amount of working hours. 
	- Increases marginal product of labour. 
	- Opportunity cost of free time is higher -> leads to higher incentive to work. 
	- Since product increases per hour, workers may want to give up some product for more free time. 

Income and substitution effects on hours of work and free time
- If it is assumed that spending cannot exceed earning, the maximum level of consumption is:
  c = w(24 - t)
	- where c is the maximum level of consumption,
	- w = wages
	- t = hours of free time
- This is called budget constraint.
