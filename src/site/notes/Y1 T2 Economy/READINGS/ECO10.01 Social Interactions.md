Unit 4
- Game theory: way of understanding how people interact and decide their actions based on their motives, beliefs and circumstantial constraints. 
	- Motives: self-interest, concern for others, fairness. 
- Interactions include both conflicts of interest and opportunity for mutual gain. 
- Pursuit of self-interest ([[Y1 T2 Economy/CONCEPTS/Invisible Hand\|Invisible Hand]]) can lead to outcomes that are good for all participants, or none.
- Incentives to self-interest provided by the government can be used to regulate the market by adding constraints and punishing actions with bad consequences. 
- Concern for others and fairness contribute to good outcomes for all. 

- Social dilemma: actions taken in self-interest that lead to consequences that are inferior to an outcome in which there had been collaborative decision-making. 

The Tragedy of the Commons
- By Garrett Hardin. 
- Resources that are not owned by anyone are often exploited. 
	- Generally naturally-occurring resources such as air, water, etc. 
- Free riders: people who gain benefits from the action of an individual. This individual bears the cost of the action. 
	- The individual who bears the cost is called altruistic. 
	- The costs are also distribute through government policy (eg green credits), institutions using community collaboration and international treaties. 

4.1 Social Interactions: Game Theory
- If people were left to their own devices to pursue self-interest, the world would regulate itself through this pursuit. 
	- Eg. if there was no law about which side of the road to drive on, and if everyone was already driving on the left, an individual would also drive on the left out of self-interest (avoiding a collision). 
Social and strategic interactions
- Social interactions: situations in which there are two or more people, and the actions they take affect each other's outcomes. 
- Strategic interaction: when people in a social interaction are aware of the effects of their actions on others. 
- A strategy is an action that a person takes in a strategic interaction.
- A game is a model of a strategic interaction. 
- Therefore, game theory is a set of games.
- Payoff: gain or loss caused by joint actions of players. 

4.2 Equilibrium in the invisible hand game
- To predict the outcome of a game, the best response must be selected. 
	- The strategy that will give the player the highest payoff, taking into account the responses of other players.
- Dominant strategy: the strategy that will give provide the highest payoff regardless of the other players' responses. 
	- When all players play their dominant strategy, the dominant strategy equilibrium is created. 
- *Homo economicus*: selfish man. 
	- [[Y1 T2 Economy/PEOPLE/Adam Smith\|Adam Smith]] explained that men are not simply selfish beings, but do consider the happiness of others. 
	- Francis Edgeworth disagreed, saying that every man only cares about his own self-interest.
	- Some economists say that seemingly altruistic actions have a long-term self-interest, and motivated by social approval. 

4.3 Prisoners' Dilemma
- The dominant strategies do not cause the best response in this case.
- This occurs when no value is placed on the payoffs of the other person, when no agreement is made beforehand and when no way exists to compensate for damages. 
- Hence, in this situation, the best response can only occur if the dominant strategy is not played. 

4.4 Social Preferences: Altruism
- Social preferences: preferences that place a value on what happens to other people. 
	- Altruistic social preferences mean the individual is willing to bear the costs for the benefit of another. 
	- Spite and envy are also social preferences.
- Altruistic preferences as indifference curves:
	- Deriving utility from the consumption of another/bearing the cost. 

4.5 Altruistic preferences in the prisoners' dilemma
- Social dilemmas are easier to resolve when people have altruistic tendencies. 
- This leads to the best response for both parties. 

4.6 Public goods, free riding, and repeated interaction
- Public good: not owned by one single person, available for the use of all.
	- Often, individuals need to bear a cost to maintain/provide it. Everyone benefits from this. 
- Repeated games can affect the strategy used by the players. 
- Elinor Ostrom explained how the exploitation of public goods could be prevented through social norms and rules. 
	- She disagreed with [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]], stating that covenants could be made and followed without the pressure of the government (a "sword").

4.7 Public good contributions and peer punishment
- High levels of cooperation can be sustained if there is a mechanism for punishing free riders. 
	- Without it, there is a decrease in altruism over time. 

4.8 Behavioural experiments in the lab and in the field
- Economists learn people's preferences from: survey questions and statistical studies of economic behaviour. 
	- Observing preferences through looking at purchases is called revealed preference. 
- Experiments are also used, to measure what people actually do rather than what they say. 
	- They can be replicated and all subjects are placed on common ground, so difference in behaviour would depend on difference in preferences. 


——— Class notes ———
- Game theory: way of understanding how people interact and make decisions based on their constraints, beliefs and motives. 
  Requirements:
	- Players/participants.
	- These players must have strategies (set of actions to take).
	- Pay-offs (consequences of their actions)
- Dominant strategy: the action that gives the highest payoffs in all situations. 
	- When players know a dominant strategy exists, they would not play a dominated strategy. 
- Whichever cell has all best payoffs marked, is called the equilibrium.
	- Class example: two prisoners can choose to confess or not confess. Dominant strategy: to confess (for both of them). Confess-confess is the equilibrium. 
	- Every equilibrium by the dominant strategy mechanism would definitely be equilibrium by the Nash strategy equilibrium. The opposite is not necessarily true. 
	- Some situations do not have equilibria. 

- Common Knowledge of Rationality: an assumption made that states that each player is rational, and is able to emit to others that they are rational. 
- Normal form/strategic form: similar to Eisenhower matrix, representation of game theory. 
- Situations where you make your actions either simultaneously or sequentially. 
- First mover's advantage
