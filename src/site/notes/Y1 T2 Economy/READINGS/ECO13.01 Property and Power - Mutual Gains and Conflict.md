Institutions govern interactions between members of a group by implementing incentives and constraints.
- Incentives are economic rewards or punishments which influence the benefits and costs of alternative courses of action. 
- Institutions are also called 'rules of the game' (in game theory).
- Institutions also determine the power each individual holds.
[[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/Power\|Power]]: the ability of individuals to do and get things they want in opposition to the intentions of others. 
- Can set the terms of an exchange. 
- Can impose or threaten to impose heavy costs. 
Bargaining power: the extent of a person's advantage in securing a larger share of economic rents made possible by an interaction. 

Usually, the responder has the power to say no to a proposal. When they don't, the game is called the dictator game. 

Allocation: the outcome of an economic interaction. 
- When everyone involved in an interaction prefers allocation A over B, it is a Pareto dominant interaction.
- The criterion for judging is called the Pareto criterion. 

Limitations of Pareto efficiency
- Multiple Pareto-efficient allocations can exist.
- The criterion does not rank the allocations. 
- It is not fair.

5.3 Fairness
- The knowledge of some facts may change our perception of fair and unfair. 
- Allocations can be judged by two standards:
	- Substantive: how unequal they are.
	- Procedural: how they came about. 
Rawls proposed a veil of ignorance:
1. Use a principle of fairness that applies to everyone.
2. Imagine a veil of ignorance that does not allow us to see the position we may occupy in society.
3. Make a judgement from behind this veil of ignorance. 

Technically feasible sets:
- Production function determines feasible frontier.
- Constraint 1: biological survival. 

Reservation option: next best alternative. 

Measuring economic inequality: 
Lorenz curves
- Compare perfect equality to the inequality in the situation at hand by drawing two curves.
- The height of the real curve is the amount of income earned by the fraction of the population indicated on the horizontal axis.
- More inequality = more space between the Lorenz curve and the 45 degree line. 
- Gini coefficient = (A)/(A+B)
	- Where A = area between 45-degree line and Lorenz curve
	- and B = area under Lorenz curve
- When everyone has the same income, Gini = 0.

Disposable income
- Income left in hand after paying tax and receiving government transfers. 

Properties of Competitive Equilibrium 
- it is Pareto-efficient
  Slope of indifference curve (MRS) = slope of price line
- Efficient allocations can be achieved by competition. 
  Particular allocation can be obtained through appropriate redistribution of endowments.
