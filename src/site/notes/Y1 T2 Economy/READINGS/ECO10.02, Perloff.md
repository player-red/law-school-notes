Game Theory
- Assumption: all rational players try to achieve maximum payoffs. 
- Common knowledge: something all players know, and know that all others know, and so on.
- Complete information: when strategies and payoffs of the game are common knowledge.

Static games:
- Each player acts only once and all act simultaneously. 
- Normal form representation of a static game = payoff/profit matrix.

Nash equilibrium: 
- No player's expected outcome can be improved by changing strategy.
- Prisoner's dilemma is an example of the Nash equilibrium.
