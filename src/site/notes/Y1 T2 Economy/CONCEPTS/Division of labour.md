Specialization of producers to carry out different tasks in the production process. An essential feature of [[Y1 T2 Economy/CONCEPTS/Capitalism\|Capitalism]].
[[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]] explains that it causes:
a) concentration of profits for the bourgeoisie.  
b) worker disempowerment (detachment and alienation from the product of their labour — [[Y1 T2 Power/READINGS/POW2.9 Marx, Estranged Labour\|POW2.9 Marx, Estranged Labour]])
c) dehumanization of the working class, since they are then easily replaced. their skills and personalities are disregarded, and all are given the same repetitive task.
