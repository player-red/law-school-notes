<h1>HOME</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
How to access all the notes I publish + the mind maps:
- Click the menu icon.
- Expand the relevant folders and access notes.
- Mind map available at the bottom of the note.

Example link: [[Y1 T1 Society/READINGS/PRIMARY/SOC1.02 Mills, The Sociological Imagination\|SOC1.02 Mills, The Sociological Imagination]]
- This link will redirect you to my notes for the first society reading, from where you can go to other linked notes/people/concepts.

<h3>Update policy: </h3>

- This website will be updated daily, but changes will take a while to reflect.
- As and when I finish my notes for readings, you will be able to see them.
- Email me on ananya.kamath@nls.ac.in for questions, tech support (if the website isn't working) or requesting a reading. 
- Some of my reading notes are in my physical notes, so these will be updated with lower priority.
- If you want to import ALL of my files to use for yourself on Obsidian (with a proper mindmap and links), email me. Taking this route means that my files will not update automatically, because they will be locally stored.

<h3>FAQ: </h3>

1. Which app do you use for making notes?
	I use Obsidian, it's completely free except for the sync and publish features, which are easily circumvented.

2. How did you make this website?
	Using the Digital Garden plugin for Obsidian - it has step-by-step instructions on how to create a GitHub repo and host your site using Vercel.

3. Who can I share this with?
	Whoever asks, no gatekeeping in this household.
