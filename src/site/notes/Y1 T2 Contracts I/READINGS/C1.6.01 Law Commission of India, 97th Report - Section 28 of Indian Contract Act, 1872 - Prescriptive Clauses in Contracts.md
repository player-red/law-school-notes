About Sec. 28, [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]].

Prescriptive clauses: clauses that extinguish rights under a contract on the expiry of a specified period. 
- They are used since parties cannot use their own period of limitation in place of the general law period.
Sec 28 does not mean that contracts with prescription clauses are void, only those that (a) do not allow suing at any time, and (b) do not allow suing after a limited time. 

Argues that barring the right, rather than just the remedy causes unjust situations and a greater advantage for one party.
- Freedom of contract: freedom must be curtailed if such clauses have potential to cause serious hardship and injustice.

RECOMMENDATION: prescriptive clauses cannot be defended, mostly because they are used against consumers, especially by large corporations who use "take it or leave it" contracts. This leads to inequality of bargaining power, giving the corporations a superior position. 
- Hardship to economically disadvantaged: violating economic justice.
- Harms interests of consumers.
- Illogical: allows restriction of rights rather than remedies.
- Distinction is too subtle to easily apply to real-life cases.
