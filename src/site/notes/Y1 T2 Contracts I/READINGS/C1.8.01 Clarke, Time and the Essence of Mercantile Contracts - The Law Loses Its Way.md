[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Performance\|Performance]] of contractual obligations. 
Time is of the essence when:
- The contract explicitly states this.
- If reasonable notice is given, saying that the obligation must be performed by a given date.
- The nature and surrounding circumstances of the contract require it.
	- i.e. failure to perform on time would result in one party losing benefits which were intended to be obtained from the contract.
English courts: time is of the essence in mercantile contracts. 
Due to: (1) precedent (sea voyages in the past), (2) when the performance of one party affects the ability of the other party to perform, (3) substantial deprivation or if the contract says so.
