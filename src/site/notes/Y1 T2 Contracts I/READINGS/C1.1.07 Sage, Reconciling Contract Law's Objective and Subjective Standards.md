- Objective point of view: how a reasonable person would construe the terms of the contract, what the parties actually do through the contract.
- Subjective point of view: what parties intended to do through the contract.
- These two standards are not rivals, they complement each other. 

- Cornish v Martin: when a party uses language which conveys a certain meaning, he cannot say that he is not bound by it if the other party has acted upon his words.

- Linguistic theorists use three strategies to explain away the subjective view of contract law:
	- Denial: believe that subjectivity is not appropriate in contract law. 
	- Objectifying: believe that the results of using the objective method where the subjective has been used can be the same. 
	- Hiving off: explaining subjective aspects of the law by assigning them to departments of legal doctrine. 

- Explaining both standards with a single rationale:
	- PS Atiyah: believed that contractual liability was undertaken to protect reliance. Generally does not care about subjective intent and enforces the appearance of the promise. 
	- Joseph Raz: contract law supports the practice of assuming voluntary obligations.
