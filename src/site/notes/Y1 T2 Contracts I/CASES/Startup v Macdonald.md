Facts:
Contract wherein plaintiff agrees to supply 10 tonnes of linseed oil within the last fourteen days of March. Delivers at 9 pm, 31st March, which is refused on the grounds of being too late. Tries to deliver again on 3rd April at 9 am, refused by defendant.

Possible argument: Sec. 38 — offered to perform ([[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Performance\|Performance]]).

Judgement:
- Law implies that delivery should be done at a reasonable time.
- Act of delivering goods is not unilateral, requires concurrence of both deliverer and the one receiving the delivery. 
- Since a day was decided, not a time, 11:59pm was seen as the deadline. 
- Ruled that the defendant had enough time to examine the goods, since he was in his warehouse.
- Had the defendant not been present, plaintiff would have lost the case, since the defendant had no obligation to staying and waiting at the warehouse beyond working hours.
