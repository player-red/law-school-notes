Facts:
Digilandmall.com was an online IT company that sold software and hardware from Singapore. On their website, an HP laser printer was listed for $66, whereas the same printer was $3854 on the official HP website. The defendants did not notice till 4,000 printers were ordered, and sent out a notification saying that they would not be able to fulfill it due to their mistake. The plaintiffs had ordered 100 printers each. 

Issues:
- Whether the pricing was a [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Mistake\|Mistake]] and whether this mistake allowed for voiding of the contract.

Decision:
In favor of defendants.
- Contract rendered void.
- No [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consensus ad idem\|Consensus ad idem]] between the two parties.
- Pricing was a mistake and the plaintiffs must have known this, since it was absurdly low.
- Unilateral mistake: usually, when entering into a contract, the original intention of the parties is overlooked, and a contract may be valid even if one party makes a contract. Exception: when the other party is aware that the first party made a mistake.
