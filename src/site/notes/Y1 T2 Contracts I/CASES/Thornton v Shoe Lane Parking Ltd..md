tags: #acceptance 

Facts:
- Automatic parking machine that dispensed tickets mentioning existence of conditions to park, not the conditions themselves. 
- Plaintiff physically injured and claimed the garage was responsible for 50% of the harm. 

Held:
- Exclusion clause on the ticket came after the contract had already been created.
- The company did not take enough action to inform the customer about the liability clause.
- The automatic machine meant the customer could not negotiate or reject the terms. 
- Ruled in favor of the plaintiff. 

Similar to [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CASES/Lalman Shukla v Gauri Dutt\|Lalman Shukla v Gauri Dutt]]: since the plaintiff did not know the conditions, he could not have said to have accepted them.
