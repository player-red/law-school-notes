Facts:
- Plaintiff was supposed to sell two consignments of iodized salt, but they were not delivered. 
- Wrote a letter claiming the value of the goods (53, 264 and 51,686rs.) but the Railway offered only 9,111 and 9,032rs. and stated that, if the cheques were encashed or retained, the claim would be complete in full. 
- Sent letters of protest and encashed the cheques, then filed a case against the defendants for the full payment. 

Issue:
- Did encashing the cheques amount to [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Acceptance\|Acceptance]] of the terms of the Railway? 

Section 8: [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]]
Acceptance by performing conditions/receiving consideration
Section 7:
Acceptance must be unconditional and absolute. 

Decision:
In case of protest letter written before encashment:
- Court held that the acceptance of the money was made under protest, hence there was no accord and satisfaction. 
	- The acceptance was made conditionally. 
	- Acceptance must be unconditional and absolute, hence this did not amount to contract. 
However, there is no way to prove which came first (encashment or protest letter), hence the appeal fails and the case is decided in favor of the Railway, since if encashment was first and protest letter second, acceptance was unequivocal.
