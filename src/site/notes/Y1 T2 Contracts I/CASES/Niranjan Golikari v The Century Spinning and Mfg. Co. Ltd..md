[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Restraint of trade\|Restraint of trade]].
Facts:
Appellant hired by respondents, signing an employment contract with multiple clauses to prevent the spread of their trade secrets. Clause 17: if he resigned from the company, he would not be allowed to join a competitor for 5 years, and would have to pay damages worth 6 months of the salary he would have earned plus his training fee.
Confidentiality restriction: no time limit imposed.

Decision:
In favour of Century Spinning: it spent time and money training the employee, and could not let their trade secret be exposed to a rival company. Uses the language of reasonableness and the general doctrine of the restraint of trade. Stricter approach for employer-employee relationships since there is inequality of bargaining power.
