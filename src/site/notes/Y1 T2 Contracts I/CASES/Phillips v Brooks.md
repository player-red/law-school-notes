King's Bench Division

Facts:
North entered the plaintiff's shop, and bought pearls and a ring worth 3000 pounds in total. While signing the cheque, North said his name was Sir George Bullough, which the plaintiff verified with the address on the cheque. Plaintiff allowed him to take the ring. Later on, the cheque was dishonored. 
Plaintiff said he only gave him the ring since he thought North was SGB, and would not have given it to him otherwise. Asked for return of the ring or its value and damages for its detention. 
North pledged the ring to Brooks under the name Firth. Brooks were pawnbrokers who acted in good faith, unaware of the fraud. 

Issues:
1) When a seller is induced to sell goods to someone who is fraudulently misrepresenting their identity, does the property pass to the fraudulent purchaser?
2) Is [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Mistake\|Mistake]] of identity grounds to void the contract?

Similar to [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CASES/Cundy v Lindsay\|Cundy v Lindsay]].
Except that an agreement did not exist in Cundy, here an agreement does exist.

Judgement:
In favor of defendants.
- Rejected the claim that the plaintiff only intended to contract with SGB. 
- The sale was voidable on part of the plaintiff before property passed to Brooks. 
- [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Misrepresentation\|Misrepresentation]] of identity did not negate the actual contract.
- The defendants acted in good faith and could claim the title.
