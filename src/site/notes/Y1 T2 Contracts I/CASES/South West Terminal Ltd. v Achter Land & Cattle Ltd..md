Facts: 
Parties entered into a delivery purchase contract. The flax required was not delivered, so the plaintiff sued for breach of contract. The defendant denied entering into a contract, saying no note was made or signed by the parties.

The defendant responded to the offer of the plaintiff with a thumbs-up emoji (👍). This was understood as acceptance by the plaintiff, though the defendant argued that it was only an acknowledgement of the receipt. 

Judgement: 
The parties often used short-form communication to express assent to contracts in the past. Also, the dictionary of the emoji is "I approve". Hence, any reasonable bystander would have inferred the meaning of the emoji as acceptance.
