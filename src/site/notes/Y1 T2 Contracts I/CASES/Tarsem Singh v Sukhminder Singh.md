Facts:
A and B entered into a contract for sale of land, and 77k was paid by B to A as earnest money. Condition in contract: if B failed to pay the balance amount, the earnest money would be forfeited. A did not execute the sales deed in favor of B, hence A sued for specific performance. 
Both A and B suffered from [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Mistake\|Mistake]] in that they believed the land was being sold at different rates, ie one 'Bigha' and one 'Canal'.
A contended that since B did not offer the balance amount and did not obtain the sales deed, the earnest money could not be refunded.

Issues:
- Whether both parties being under [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Mistake\|Mistake]] of fact made the agreement void.
- Whether A could be asked to refund the earnest money if the agreement was void.

Judgement:
In favour of B. 
- Agreement was void from inception since both parties suffered from Mistake of fact. 
- Hence, the forfeiture clause was also void, and A would have to refund the earnest money to B. 
	- Under Sec. 65, [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]].
