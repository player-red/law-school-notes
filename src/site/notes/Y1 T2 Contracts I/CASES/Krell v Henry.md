Facts:
Defendant agreed to hire a flat from the plaintiff in Pall Mall, where the coronation procession would pass through. The contract did not contain the purpose of the agreement. Deposit paid, but the procession did not take place on the days originally decided. Hence, the defendant refused to pay the rest of the rent. 
Original decision by Darling J.: both parties agreed that the procession's original days formed the basis of the contract. Contingent event did not happen, making it unfair to ask the defendant to pay the rent. Used [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CASES/Taylor v Caldwell\|Taylor v Caldwell]], holding that there was an implied condition.

Arguments:
- Defendant: total failure of [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consideration\|Consideration]] due to processions not taking place, and hence wanted his deposit of 25 pounds back. Prices were greatly inflated due to the procession, and the apartment was hired only for the day (not the night, further cementing intent to view the procession).
- Plaintiff: both parties did expect a procession and the price was fixed accordingly, but that nothing was said about it in the contract.

Judgement:
Conditions for rescission:
- A thing not coming into being (which did not exist before the contract)
- A thing incapacitated from doing the work intended
	- No default on part of the person expected to pay the price
	- Physical extinction or not coming into existence of the subject matter, which would render the contract impossible to perform. 
In this case, [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Performance\|Performance]] was still possible. However, the foundation for the contract must remain in existence.
Held that the goal for which the contract was created could not be completed, hence the contract was frustrated and the appeal must be dismissed. 

Objective argument: you are renting the apt. for the purpose of living there, regardless of your original intent in renting it (in this case viewing the procession).
Subjective argument: you rented the apartment because you wanted to see the procession. If you cannot see it for whatever reason, the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Motive\|Motive]] behind the contract is defeated, and the contract became useless.
Court accepted the subjective argument.
