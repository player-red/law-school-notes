House of Lords.

Facts:
Company said it was permitted to use steam-powered engines rather than horses for construction by Special Act. However, it required permission from a Board Trade which did not give permission. Plaintiffs bought a stake in the business under the belief that they would be using steam-powered engines. Brought a claim for deceit when the business liquidated.

Issue:
Whether the statement made by the defendants was fraudulent or simply incorrect. 

Decision: 
Statement was not deceitful since it was made in good faith. Defendants not held liable. 
Lord Halsbury: mens rea absent, essential for deceit.
Lord Bramwell: did not want the decision to allow promoters to believe that they could make untrue statements with no consequences.
Lord Fitzgerald: defendants subjected to long cross-examination, and are hence innocent.
Lord Herschell's formulation:
[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Fraud\|Fraud]] is proved when:
- False representation is made knowingly
- or without belief in its truth
- or recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. 
Determined that a company has no duty to use care and skill to avoid misstatements when making a prospectus. 
- This has since become bad law.

Under current Indian law, would this be [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Misrepresentation\|Misrepresentation]]? - Yes.
