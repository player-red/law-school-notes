Facts:
Defendant owned a large plot of land which was divided into smaller plots for development of residential complexes.
Company entered into agreements to sell these plots without specifying a limit to deposits.
Plaintiff deposited Rs 101 as earnest money. Shortly after, the land was requisitioned by the government for military purposes. Defendant argued since it became impossible to complete their end of the contract, it would either refund the earnest money or resume construction after the war ended. Plaintiff filed a suit instead.
Two decisions in favour of the plaintiff, one in favour of the defendant. 

Decision:
Ruled in favour of the plaintiff. The government only took the land for temporary use. If time had been essential to the contract, the contract might have been frustrated. However, no specific time frame was mentioned, and it was supposed to be completed after the war. Hence, the contract was still enforceable.
