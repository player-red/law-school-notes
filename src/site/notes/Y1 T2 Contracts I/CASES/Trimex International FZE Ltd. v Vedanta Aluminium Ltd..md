Facts: email exchanges between the two parties led to an agreement between them on the supply of 5 shipments of bauxite to India. 

Issue: did a valid contract exist between the two parties in the absence of a formal contract?

Decision:
Yes, a valid contract existed. A contract is said to be concluded when both parties agree on essential terms of the contract, whether orally or in writing. The creation of a formal contract does not affect the implementation of the contract.
