Facts:
Respondent eligible for 250 sq. mtr. plot and asked to pay various amounts of deposits, which he did on time and eventually paid the entire amount. Was asked to collect the possession letter later. However, the DSIDC did not hand over possession, stating that the respondent's unit occupied only 100 sq yards while his application was for 400sq.m. A writ petition was filed and allowed by a Single Judge. Appealed by DSIDC. 

Arguments:
Appellants: respondent cannot claim more than he is entitled to, since it is a government scheme intended to benefit relocation of industrial units (due to [[Y1 T2 Torts/CASES/M.C. Mehta v UoI\|M.C. Mehta v UoI]]). Hence, it was not a simple contract between government and allottee. The later amendment to the policy was in public interest since there was a shortage of land. (However, the DSIDC themselves worked against the policy even when they were aware of it by allotting the 250 sqm plot to the respondents and collecting the amount).

Respondents: offer of allotment accepted, full payment made. Hence, the contract concluded, and the NCT must perform their part. 

Judgement:
In favour of the respondents. 
Clause (c) of a Note for Council of Ministers: size of plot recommended should not exceed more than double of the area presently used. No restriction for those applying for industrial flats.
Appellants acted negligently despite being aware of this clause, and undermined it. 
Court decided that a contract arose, and that its terms and conditions could only be changed with mutual consent, not unilaterally. 
Mutual [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Mistake\|Mistake]] did not exist, nor did any mistake that prevented a binding contract from coming into existence.
