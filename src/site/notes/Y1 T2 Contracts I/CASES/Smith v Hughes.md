Queen's Bench Division

Facts:
Hughes was a racehorse trainer, and Smith a farmer. Smith wanted to sell him oats, which Hughes then ordered at a fixed price. When some amount was delivered, Hughes refused to pay the amount since they were not the product he thought he bought. 
Originally, the County Court acknowledged Hughes' mistake, and said if Smith knew it, the case would be decided in Hughes' favour, which it was. 

Issue:
Whether Hughes' [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Mistake\|Mistake]] allowed him to avoid the contract, especially if Smith was aware of the mistake on Hughes' part.

Judgement:
The contract could not be avoided. It was not simply a case of [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consensus ad idem\|Consensus ad idem]], it was also important to analyze how both parties had communicated with each other using their actions and words. It was held that Smith had no duty to inform Hughes of his mistake, as per the principle of [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Caveat emptor\|Caveat emptor]]. Cockburn held that if ordinary diligence was possible on Hughes' part, Smith had no duty to disclose. This was because Smith did not lead Hughes to believe the oats were old, it was self-deception (Blackburn). 
- Unilateral mistake: not grounds for rescission of contract.
