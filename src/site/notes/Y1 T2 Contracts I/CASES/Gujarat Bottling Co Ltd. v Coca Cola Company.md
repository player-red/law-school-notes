[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Restraint of trade\|Restraint of trade]].
Facts:
GBC and Coca-Cola entered into a contract in which GBC would not be allowed to deal with any other company's goods while the agreement was in effect (1993 agreement: terminate with 1 years' notice). GBC sold to PepsiCo and new owners have a notice of termination, within 90 days according to the 1994 agreement. Sued by Coca-Cola, HC issued order prohibiting GBC from handling any other brand's products.
Two contracts: second one had to be followed (alteration and novation of contracts).


Issue:
- Was the HC justified in enforcing the negative covenant?

Decision:
In favour of Coca-Cola, interim injunction upheld by SC.
