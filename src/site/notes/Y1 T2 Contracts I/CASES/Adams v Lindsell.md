Facts: A offered to sell certain goods to B by letter, B posted acceptance. Due to misdirection of the mail, the letter arrived two days later than it should have. By then, A already sold the goods to someone else.

[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Communication\|Communication]]: acceptance is confirmed the moment the offerree posts acceptance. Hence, when B posted acceptance, a valid contract was formed between the two parties, and B was entitled to recover against A.
