/tags: #invitation_to_treat  #offer 
An exception to the presumption that advertisements are usually invitations to treat. Similar to [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CASES/Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company\|Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]].

Issue:
- Whether the advertisement to sell was an [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Offer\|Offer]] or an invitation to treat.

Judgement:
- The advertisement stated that the defendant would sell the garments to whoever came first, at $1. 
- There was no 'house rule' in the advertisement stating that the store only sold to women.
- After acceptance, one cannot add/change arbitrary conditions. 
- An ad can be considered an offer in certain circumstances, especially when the acceptance can be made explicit.
