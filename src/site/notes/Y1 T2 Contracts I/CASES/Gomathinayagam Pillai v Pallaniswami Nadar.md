Facts:
G Pillai and his son C Pillai owned a piece of land. P Pillai, G Pillai's son, was standing trial for murder. They decided to sell their land for money for legal fees to P Nadar for Rs 15,006 and received Rs 1,006 as part payment. 
No time fixed for completion of sale, and it was an oral contract. 
31st March: P Pillai convicted for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
4th April: Nadar gave Pillais another Rs 2,000 (Rs 3,006 in total now) and executed a written agreement for the sale deed to be executed by 15th April 1959, when the remaining price would be paid. 
If the respondent raised any objection to the sale deed, he would lose the Rs 3,006 advance amount. If the appellant raised any objection they would have to add an additional Rs 3,000.
Sale deed not executed on or before April 15, and after consulting the Vakil, not even on April 30. 
July 30, a letter was sent by the appellants to the respondent blaming them for the delays. 

Issues:
(1) Whether time was of the essence
(2) Whether the respondent was not ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.

Decision:
- Intention to show that time is of the essence should be unmistakable in the wording of the contact and inferred from the circumstances and nature of the property agreed to be sold. 
- Reinstated the Trial Court's decision, which found that time was of the essence due to: 
	- No time prescribed, but they were fixing dates for performance.
	- Penalties imposed on guilty parties.
	- Appellants were in urgent need of money.
