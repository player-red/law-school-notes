Facts:
The plaintiff received a large loan from his business partner and claimed this sum is deductible from taxation since it would be repaid. 

Decision:
The court held that the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Intention to enter into legal relations\|Intention to enter into legal relations]] could not be inferred from the case at hand, and that the sum was not deductible and must be taxed. This was because the sum was received without any obligation, consideration or rate of interest.
