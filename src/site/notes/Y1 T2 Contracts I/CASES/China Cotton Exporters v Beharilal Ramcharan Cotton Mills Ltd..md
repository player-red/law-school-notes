Facts:
Appellants entered into a contract of sale with respondent on 9th Aug. 31st Oct, 10,000lbs delivered and remaining (40,000) not delivered till the end of November. They admitted failure to deliver, but attributed it to failure of intermediaries and other circumstances not under their control. They contended that the date of delivery was only a suggestion and that time was not of the essence to the contract.
They also claimed they were exempted from liability in case of delay due to obtaining an import license, but the Trial Court held that there was no delay in obtaining the license.

Judgement:
Use of the word "therefore" to refer to the shipment date not being guaranteed: only referred to a delay well within the bounds of October/November 1950, and nothing in the contract showed the intention of a date not being guaranteed. (commercial contracts: time is generally of the essence, further proven by the existence of penalties for delay of delivery).
Hence, defendant held liable for non-delivery of goods.
