Facts:
Arbitration clause read that the Engineer would give the final and binding decision if no claim to arbitration was communicated by either party within 90 days. If the Engineer did not give notice of his decision within 90 days, or if either of the parties is dissatisfied with his decision, both must appoint one arbitrator each who have full power to do (essentially whatever they want).

Judgement:
- Arbitration award upheld, saying that it was in accordance with the contractual agreement.
