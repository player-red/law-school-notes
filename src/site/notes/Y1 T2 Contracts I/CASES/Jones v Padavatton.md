Facts:
Mother agreed to maintain daughter if she studied for the bar. The mother later agreed to provide a house in which her daughter could live while studying. Dispute over occupancy of the house arose, and mother wanted possession. 

Decision:
Mother was successful in obtaining possession, since the court ruled that there was no intention to create a legally binding contract, rather was a family arrangement based on love and trust. There was also no formal agreement between mother and daughter. Hence, the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Intention to enter into legal relations\|Intention to enter into legal relations]] could not be inferred from the case at hand.
