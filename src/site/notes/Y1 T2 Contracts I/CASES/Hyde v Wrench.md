Facts: 
Offer by defendant: to sell his farm for 1000 pounds.
Plaintiff offered to buy it for 950 pounds, which the defendant did not accept. The plaintiff later offered 1000 pounds for the farm, with no assent from the defendant.

Decision:
The court held that the plaintiff, on rejecting the original proposal, made a [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Counter-offer\|Counter-offer]]. Without the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Acceptance\|Acceptance]] of the defendant, there would be no valid contract. This laid down the principle of the counter-offer killing the original offer.
