Facts: 
An agreement with an arbitration clause which proposed that the decision of the arbitrator was final and binding between the parties, and that they relinquished any right to appeal or object to the decision.
[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Severability\|Severability]] clause: 
If one part of the agreement was invalid, illegal or unenforceable (as decided by a court), the remainder would still be enforceable, by treating the invalid parts as if they were never included.

Judgement:
The arbitration clause completely took away the right of the parties to challenge the award, which was against [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Public policy\|Public policy]] — hence unlawful and unenforceable. 
Held that partial invalidity would not make the entire contract invalid or unenforceable. [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Blue Pencil Doctrine\|Blue Pencil Doctrine]] used, petition upheld.
- Distinguishes between substantial severability and textual divisibility: not bothered with trivial/syntax-related parts.
- Consider whether the parties could have agreed on the remainder of the contract knowing that some parts were unlawful or illegal.
