[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consideration\|Consideration]], [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Public policy\|Public policy]].

Facts:
Respondents managers in the CWT, terminated by use of unconscionable terms in contract of employment. (Used notice period clause to terminate on grounds of negligence, without giving a hearing).

Issues:
- Whether CWT comes under the definition of State as defined under [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Legal Methods/CONSTITUTION/Article 12\|Article 12]].
- Whether a term of employment which is ==unconscionable== is void under section 23 of the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]].

Held:
- Contract of employment has to be analyzed under contract law first.
- 'Unconscionable' definition: goes against what is right, irreconcilable with conscience.
- Freedom of contract: only crime and tort excluded. Other exceptions: 
	- Equity: forfeiture clauses to ensure that a party fulfills their part of the contract, when penalty is much too high as compared to damages from non-performance, a court of equity would reduce the penalty. Expectant heirs: moneylenders would charge a very high rate of interest if an expectant heir borrowed money. 
	- Legislation: usury law (prohibit charging high rates of interest), debt relief (forgives a certain amount/all debt under certain conditions), regulation of working hours (setting limits to prevent opportunistic employers), conditions of service (cannot be relinquished by employment contracts).
- Now, freedom of contract has a lower value in the modern world.
	- Due to contracts of adhesion: standardized contracts (on a take-it-or-leave-it basis: no negotiations).
- Judicial and legislative trends: protection for weaker parties from harsh contracts (such as labour and consumer protection, protection from undue influence, good faith and fair dealing).
- Distributive justice: 
	- Corrective justice between the parties to a contract. 
- Inequality of bargaining power: Lloyds Bank v Bundy.
- Judge believes Indian courts should advance with the times.
- Since Art 14 provides equality, a certain amount of economic justice must also be enforced.
- Contracts with terms with unreasonable terms would not be enforced, based on the principle of unconscionability based on inequality of bargaining power (disparity between corporation and employees).
	- Will not apply to private contracts.
- Sec. 16 not used: no undue pressure or multiplicity of proceedings. Used for commercial contracts.
- "shock the conscience of the Court": rare/exceptional circumstances.
- Henry VIII clauses: arbitrary and discriminatory powers given to the State, which may go against public interest.
