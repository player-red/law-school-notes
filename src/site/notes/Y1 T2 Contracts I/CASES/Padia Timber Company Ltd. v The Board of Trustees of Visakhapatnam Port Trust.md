Facts:
The port trust issued a tender for the supply of wooden sleepers, which the company accepted with some conditions (conditional acceptance). The port trust tried modifying these conditions and later issued a purchase order. The company did not agree to this, so the port trust sued for breach of contract. 

Decision:
The Supreme Court held that there was no valid contract since the company did not accept the trust's offer, rather made a [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Counter-offer\|Counter-offer]] of their own. Without unconditional [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Acceptance\|Acceptance]] of the original offer, no valid contract is created. Hence, the company was entitled to a refund of the deposit.
