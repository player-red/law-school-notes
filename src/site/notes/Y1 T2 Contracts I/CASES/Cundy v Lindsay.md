House of Lords.

Facts:
The claimant received an order for sale of handkerchiefs from a person named Blenkarn, who signed in his name in a manner resembling “Blenkiron & Co.”- a reputed firm located at “123, Wood Street”. The purchaser further mentioned his address to be at “37, Wood Street, Cheapside”, to which the claimant sent the goods. Although no payment was made by Blenkarn, he sold the goods to a third person- the defendants.

Later, the claimants alleged that, as they sold the goods to Blenkarn under the mistaken assumption that they were selling it to Blenkiron & Co., there was no real consent to the contract of sale. Consequently, there was no valid transfer of title, which remained with the claimants, and accordingly, they sued the defendants for conversion of goods.

Issue: 
Whether mistake of identity of a contracting party negates the consent of the other party.

Decision: 
There was no [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consensus ad idem\|Consensus ad idem]] since the claimant never intended to sell the goods to the defendant. Hence, the contract was declared to be void since a valid transfer of title did not occur, it remained with the claimant.
