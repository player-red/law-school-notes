Issues:
- Whether a contract arose between the two parties when the owner communicated his lowest price, ie, whether this communication was an [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Offer\|Offer]] or mere invitation to treat.

Arguments:
- Plaintiff argues that by saying he would accept no less than 10,000 rupees, the defendant made a counter-offer. 

Judgement:
- Court cited [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CASES/Harvey v Facey\|Harvey v Facey]], stating that a mere statement suggesting the lowest price at which the owner would sell does not imply a contract to sell at that price.
