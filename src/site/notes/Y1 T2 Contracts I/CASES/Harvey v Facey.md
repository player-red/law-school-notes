[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CASES/MacPherson v Appanna\|MacPherson v Appanna]] was decided based on this landmark judgement. 

Issue:
- Whether the defendant's communication of the lowest acceptable price was an offer or mere invitation to treat.

Judgement:
- No contract had been formed, the second telegram was a statement of the minimum price at which he would consider selling.
- Lacked the element of willingness to enter into a binding agreement. ([[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Offer\|Offer]] – element ii)
