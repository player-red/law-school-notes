Facts:
- Appellant: Bharat Petroleum, Respondent: Great Eastern Shipping
- Time charter party valid till 30th June 1998.
- Extended till 31st August 1998. 
- Multiple offers and counteroffers were exchanged, and the parties did not agree on any.
- Appellant used the ship till August 1999, did not pay the respondents or redeliver the vessel.

Issues:
- Whether on the expiry of the extended period of the charter, the charter contract came to an end?
- Whether [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Acceptance\|Acceptance]] can be shown through actions, despite silence?

Decision:
- In some situations, the offerree's silence, combined with conduct becomes an expression of acceptance. (agreement sub silentio)
- The contract came to an end in 1998, but since the appellant did not redeliver the vessel, it still existed for that purpose. 

Section 8, 9 [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]].
