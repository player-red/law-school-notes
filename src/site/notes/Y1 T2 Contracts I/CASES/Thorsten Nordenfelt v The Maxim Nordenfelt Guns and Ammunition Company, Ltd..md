[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Restraint of trade\|Restraint of trade]]
Facts:
Thorsten was a patent holder who signed a covenant with the company, stating that he would carry out business with any other competing ammunitions company for 25 years except on behalf of the company itself. Afterwards, he entered into an agreement with other manufacturers of guns and ammunition. 

Argument of the appellant: the agreement was restricted in terms of time, not space. It was an unreasonable restriction to expect him not to carry out business anywhere in the world. 

Judgement: 
Held that the restriction was reasonable. Emphasis placed on the 200,000 pounds that Nordenfelt received for his sale.
Established the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Blue Pencil Doctrine\|Blue Pencil Doctrine]], removed the "and would not compete with Maxim in any way" in order to make the terms fair, using the principle of [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Severability\|Severability]].

Significance: 
Established conditions for allowing restraint of trade clauses (that were once prima facie void):
- If they seek legitimate interest
- If they are reasonable in scope from the viewpoint of the parties involved
- If they are reasonable in scope from the viewpoint of [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Public policy\|Public policy]].
