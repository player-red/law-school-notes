Facts:
Verbal agreement between husband and wife for 30 pounds a month to be paid to the wife in exchange for no further maintenance. 

Judgement:
There was no [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Intention to enter into legal relations\|Intention to enter into legal relations]] between the two parties, it was simply a domestic arrangement since it was made when they were still married. The onus to prove that a contract exited was on the plaintiff (the wife) and she was not able to do so.
