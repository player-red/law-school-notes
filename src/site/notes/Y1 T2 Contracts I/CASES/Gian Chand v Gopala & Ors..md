Facts:
Appellant entered into an agreement with respondent for sale of 3rd share of land for Rs 78,000 and paid Rs 20,000 as earnest money. Notification about Land Acquisition Act was concealed from the appellant, so he asked for a refund of the earnest money. 
One of the terms of the contract: if the government acquired the land for a public purpose, the earnest money would be refunded without interest.

Judgement:
[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Contingent Contract\|Contingent Contract]]s (S. 33, [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]])
Event that was supposed to happen became impossible due to the notification, hence the contract is frustrated and the appellant is entitled to a refund of the earnest money.
