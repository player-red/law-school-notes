Facts:
- Plaintiff constructed a market at his own expense, in order to please a Collector.
- Charged commission from defendants (tenants of shop spaces in the market).

- Decision: agreement lacked [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consideration\|Consideration]] and could not be enforced.
	- Decided according to the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Doctrine of Consideration\|Doctrine of Consideration]].
	- Construction of shops done at the desire of a third party, not the defendants. 
	- Hence, there was no [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Nexus\|Nexus]] between the two parties, which is still required even if there is past consideration.
