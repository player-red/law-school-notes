[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Rescission\|Rescission]]
Facts:
Contract rescinded between plaintiff and defendant by Federal Court due to misrepresentation by defendant, damages awarded according to SAR: (i) appreciation of property, (ii) club membership value, (iii) interest paid on loan by plaintiff, (iv) monthly interest payments made by plaintiff, (v) cost of valuation report.

Plaintiff claimed damages received were inadequate, whereas defendant claimed they were excessive.
Plaintiff: wanted damages to be calculated based on contractual breach. 
Defendant: wanted damages to be calculated based on rescinding of contract.

Issues:
1. Correct approach for calculation of damages.
2. Whether SAR's assessment was correct.

Decision:
- Rescission granted based on [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Misrepresentation\|Misrepresentation]], hence plaintiff was to be restored to his original position. 
- Damages awarded were based on remedy of rescission + extra for expenditure caused due to misrepresentation.  
- (i) and (ii) irrecoverable because they were suffered due to breach. The contract, being rescinded by the Federal Court, meant that the parties would be restored to their original positions (as they were before the contract was created).
- (v) irrecoverable since it was not a direct consequence of the fraud and it was an expense carried out due to proof of damages.
