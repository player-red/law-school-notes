Facts: 
Agreement of partnership with the object of entering into wagering transactions entered into by appellant and respondent. Profit and loss would be shared equally between them. Appellant denied liability for 50% of the loss, his defense being that entering into wagering contracts is illegal under S. 23 of the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]], and against [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Public policy\|Public policy]].

Judgement:
- Wager contracts are not illegal or against public policy, though they are void under Section 30 of the ICA.
- Partnership agreement valid, the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Object\|Object]] of the agreement did not make it unenforceable.
