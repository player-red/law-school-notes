Issues: 
- Nature and clarity of the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Offer\|Offer]] made by the employer
- Whether the plaintiff finding the child would count as acceptance
- Whether a valid contract existed between both parties
- Whether the plaintiff was entitled to receive the reward of Rs. 499

Arguments:
Plaintiff
- The act of finding the child consisted of implicit acceptance. 
- Knowledge of the offer's terms were not necessary for acceptance
	- Sec. 8, Indian Contract Act
Defendant
- Acceptance of an offer requires knowledge of the offer. Hence, no contract existed between the parties.
- Plaintiff was doing simply what he was told to do as an employee and hence was not entitled to the reward. 

Judgement (in favor of defendant)
- In order for a contract to be legally binding, there has to be mutual knowledge and acceptance of the offer.
- Plaintiff was performing an obligation that already existed, as ordered by his master.
