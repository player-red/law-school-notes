tags: #invitation_to_treat #offer 
An exception to the presumption that advertisements are usually invitations to treat. Similar to [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CASES/Lefkowitz v Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, Inc.\|Lefkowitz v Great Minneapolis Surplus Store, Inc.]].

Issue:
- Whether the advertisement was an [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Offer\|Offer]], and if anyone who performed its terms was said to be accepting it. 

Judgement:
- It was an offer that had specific terms for acceptance.
- Satisfying those terms meant acceptance.
- Purchasing or using smoke balls was a valid form of consideration.
- The company's claim that 1000 pounds were deposited at Alliance Bank showed their intention to enter a legal agreement.
