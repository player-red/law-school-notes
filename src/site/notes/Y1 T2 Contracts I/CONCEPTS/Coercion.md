Sec. 15 [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]].
- Committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the IPC
- Or unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain any property to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement. 

To prove coercion, one needs to prove causation: the pressure caused by the illegitimate act caused the person to enter into the contract. 

Legitimate v. Illegitimate Pressure
- Legitimate: not illegitimate
	- Threatening of prosecution/civil suit.
	- Economic duress when it does NOT amount to threatening to breach contract. 
- Illegitimate: prohibited by law.
	- Economic duress when it amounts to threatening to breach a contract. 
		- Usually when modifying a contract, and suing is not economically viable.
