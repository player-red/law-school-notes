[[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consideration\|Consideration]] and its relationship with contracts:
- Helps determine what agreements are contracts.
- Formal (sealed) vs informal agreements
	- If informal, the court requires consideration to determine whether it was a contract or not. 
	- In Rann v Hughes, Mansfield argued that consideration should not be looked for in cases where there is [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Intention to enter into legal relations\|Intention to enter into legal relations]]. Overruled by the House of Lords.
- Idea that one must pay a price for the undertaking that one wishes to be enforced. 
- Donations and gifts excluded.

Rationale:
- Consideration is evidence of the existence and seriousness of the agreement. 
- Welfare maximization: courts only care about enforcing contracts that provide benefits to both parties.
- Reciprocity: equal exchange between the parties, with "equal" being subjective to the parties. 
	- Differentiates trading and taking/exploiting.
