- Only parties who are part of the contract can enforce it or sue to receive benefits. 

Doctrine of Privity:
- Can a contract confer rights on a person who is not a party to the contract?
- Can a contract impose obligations on/restrict the rights of a person who is not part of it? 
Answers to both questions (Indian law): no, they cannot receive benefits or be held liable under the contract. 
English law: Third party beneficiaries (some cases) are exceptions, and are allowed to sue to enforce the contract. {Est. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, 1999}.
