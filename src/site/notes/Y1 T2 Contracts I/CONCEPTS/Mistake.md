Sec. 20 of the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/READINGS/Indian Contract Act, 1872\|Indian Contract Act, 1872]]
- An agreement is void where both parties are under mistake as to matter of fact.
	- Since there is no [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consensus ad idem\|Consensus ad idem]].
Sec. 22
- Contract caused by mistake is not voidable merely because  of mistake of one party as to matter of fact. (unilateral)

Types of mistake:
Two broad categories: mistake of law and mistake of fact (mistake of foreign law is treated as mistake of fact).
Contractual mistakes:
- Unilateral
- Mutual/Bilateral
- Common

Unilateral mistakes: mistaken belief by one party. When this gives the other party an unconscionable advantage, the contract can be voided at the mistaken party's will. 

Mutual/bilateral: when both parties are mistaken about the same material fact of the contract. [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consensus ad idem\|Consensus ad idem]] exists, but both parties are mistaken. Contract is voidable. 
- Collateral mistakes (those which have to do with the main purpose of the contract) do not provide the right of rescission. 
- Failure of mutual assent despite meeting of minds. 

Common: when both parties have the same mistaken belief of the facts.
