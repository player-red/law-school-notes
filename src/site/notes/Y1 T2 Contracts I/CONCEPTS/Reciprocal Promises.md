Promises which form the [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Consideration\|Consideration]] or part of the consideration for each other. 
All contracts are reciprocal, but not all contracts involve promises. One party may exchange performance, and another a promise. A promise has to be in the future. 
Order of [[Y1 T2 Contracts I/CONCEPTS/Performance\|Performance]]:
- concurrent/simultaneous
- dependent
- independent

Section 51: in the case of simultaneous reciprocal promises, the promisor is not bound to perform unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform. 

Section 52: order of performance
When the order is fixed by the contract: performed according to that order.
When the order is not fixed by the contract: performed according to the order that the nature of the transaction requires.
