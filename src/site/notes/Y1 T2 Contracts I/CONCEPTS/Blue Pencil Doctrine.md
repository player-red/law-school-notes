A doctrine used when some parts of a contract are void or unenforceable whereas others are valid. This allows the enforceable provisions to stand despite the nullification of the unenforceable provisions, as long as the revised version represents the original meaning of the contract. 
Courts use it when there is no doubt that parties could have agreed on the remainder of the contract even if they had known the offending clauses were illegal or unlawful. 
They do NOT use it to create new contracts between the parties.
