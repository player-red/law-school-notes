Chapter 2: Hijras, Individuality, and Izzat (pg 17-43)
tags: #feminism, #gender 

Pointers:
- Izzat: as interpreted by hijras - respect rather than honour.
- [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Intersectionality\|Intersectionality]]: hijras hold multiple intersecting identities that affect their lived experiences.

History and "Ancient" Texts
- Different types of texts: Brahmanical, Buddhist, Jain
- Different names for people considered part of the hijra community: kliba, pandaka, trtiyaprakrti, napumsaka

Views of [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]]:
- based on the linguistic genders (which even non-human objects had): purusa, stri, napumsaka
- Brahmanical: presence or absence of primary and secondary sexual characteristics
- Buddhist: presence or absence of procreative ability (napumsaka - impotence)
- Jain: distinguished between biological sex (dravyalinga) and psychological gender (bhavalinga)
	- Rejected reproductive capacity, since prepubescent girls and postmenopausal women could not reproduce.
	- Role during sexual intercourse was accepted in its place (receptive or penetrative)
	- Masculine napumsaka: both penetrative and receptive, feminine napumsaka: receptive
	- They pursued gender studies to try and determine whether women could attain moksha - led them to try and understand what exactly being a man/woman/neither a man or woman was.
	- Third-sex sexuality: male sexual desire for men, classified as hyperlibidinous.

Medieval References:
- After the advent of the Mughals, references to 'eunuchs' became more common. 
- They were seen as guardians of the harim, trusted advisors, administrators, etc.
	- Eunuchs were outsiders: foreign slaves (often of African origin) + seen as extremely trustworthy due to their physical gender-neutrality: incapable of impregnating women but also capable of manly protection. 
	- Repulsed European travelers, as they considered eunuchs to be lesser beings. 
	- During colonial times, homosexuality was criminalized and deemed unnatural -> led to the misrepresentation of eunuchs and hijras as highly sexualized.

Colonial era criminalization
- Hijras were classified as a separate caste rather than slaves/third gender individuals during the colonial period, and subsequently criminalized by the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.
	- Morally condemned hijras and their practices, confiscated their inam lands due to the British obsession with classification. 
	- This led to intense poverty and marginalization of hijra communities.
- The inherent [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Masculinity\|Masculinity]] of the British colonizers painted Indians as effeminate.
	- Indians responded to this by renouncing the material and sexual worlds, becoming sannyasis.
	- This helped proved to themselves that Indians were spiritually superior.
	- Gandhi disabled the colonial idea of a gender binary and the [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Heterosexual Matrix\|Heterosexual Matrix]] by becoming "God's eunuch", saying that a true man was both masculine and feminine. 

Contemporary Third-Sex Analyses

- Serena Nanda: critiques [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Biological Determinism\|Biological Determinism]] and the [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Heterosexual Matrix\|Heterosexual Matrix]], challenging the Western belief of only two sexes.
	- Reddy critiques her work, saying it remains within the limits of third-sex analysis, without considering other dimensions. 
- Due to the inherent intersectional identities of hijras, they cannot be understood solely through the third sex paradigm. 
- Their idea of izzat, respect, is desexualized and pertaining to their individual identity.
	- They renounce their [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Family\|Family]] to live in a community with other hijras, similar to how a sannyasi renounces his own and the material world and lives a spiritual life.
	- They also practice sexual and emotional detachment.
