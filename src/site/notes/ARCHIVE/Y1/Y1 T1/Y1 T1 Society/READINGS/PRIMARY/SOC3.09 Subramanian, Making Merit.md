(pg 291-322)

- Conflation of privilege with merit and the conversion of caste capital into modern capital (economic, cultural and social). 
- Conflicting views of caste among upper-caste students: proud of their caste identity, but also do not want it involved in entrance exams. 
- Cultural capital institutionalized through verification by IITs, premier universities recognized globally. 
	- Providing market value to cultural capital.
- For elites: caste identity declined in meaning, advantages of caste disregarded.
  For lower caste students: means of political change and obtaining dignity.

- In the age of democracy and principles of equality, 'natural differences' create stratification and a 'natural hierarchy', the aristocracy of talent. 

- EXAMPLES:
	- Kartik: could stop de-Brahminizing his Tamil and speak comfortable with students and professors alike at IIT Madras.
	- Nagaraj: assumed to be Brahmin since he entered through the general category, though he came from a backward caste background.

	- The upper castes position themselves as the 'inheritors of modernity' through their 'castelessness', while the lower castes are made the purveyors of caste. This is the [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Paradox of Castelessness\|Paradox of Castelessness]].
		- Upper caste students are deemed 'casteless' due to the distinction between the general category and the caste categories. 
		- Mandal report further marked the general category as upper caste due to recommendation of formation of the OBC category. 
	- [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/André Béteille\|André Béteille]] thinks that caste is irrelevant among urban professionals, since the upper castes cannot explain, justify or describe caste anymore, and it is reservations that perpetuate caste instead.
	- This point of view disregards the social and cultural capital ([[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/READINGS/PRIMARY/SOC3.08 Bourdieu, The Forms of Capital\|SOC3.08 Bourdieu, The Forms of Capital]], [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Pierre Bourdieu\|Pierre Bourdieu]]) people from upper castes enjoy, turning it into an inherent "talent" and "merit" that people disproportionately belonging to upper castes have.
