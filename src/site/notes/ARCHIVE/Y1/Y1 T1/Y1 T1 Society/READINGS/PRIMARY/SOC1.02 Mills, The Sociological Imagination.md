Chapter 1: The Promise
tags: #basics,

Written by [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/C. Wright Mills\|C. Wright Mills]].

==Quotes:==
- "The facts of contemporary history are also facts about the success and the failure of individual men and women."
- "Neither the life of an individual nor the history of a society can be understood without understanding both."

Pointers:
- Everyone is bounded by the private orbits within which they live: leading to a trapped feeling that grows as their awareness of their ambitions beyond their local environment grows.
- Local environment: family, friends, neighborhood, job, etc. - act as observers of this environment.
- Seemingly unrelated changes in the structure of society (factors "outside" their control): inflation, war, unemployment, etc. are the cause of this trapped feeling. 

Individual troubles and overarching issues:
- The struggles/trapped feeling of an individual: defined as "troubles" by Mills.
- He articulates that these "troubles" are a symptom of overarching "issues" of society itself, and must be understood with the context of the history, culture and current events of society. 
	- Issues occur when some value held by the public is threatened.
- If this connection is not made, individuals become unable to cope with their personal troubles, and are unable to shape society in a way such that they do not face these troubles + issues.
- Individuals need 3 vital things: information, the skills to reason, and the sociological imagination. 

[[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/The Sociological Imagination\|The Sociological Imagination]]
- The ability of individuals to understand the larger historical scene and connect it to their individual troubles, both internal and external. 
- They are then able to focus their personal uneasiness on external issues and become involved with public issues. 
- Locating themselves within their period, by becoming aware of those with the same circumstances -- makes it easier to gauge their own chances.
- Being able to shift from one perspective to another and see the relations between different perspectives.
- Tracing the links between different occurrences and using this knowledge to understand issues.

The ==3 main questions== asked by sociologists:

1. What is the structure of the society being studied, and what are its essential components?
2. How is this society located in history, and which time period is it a part of?
3. Who prevails and thrives in this society, and what is the meaning of 'human nature' for this society?

==Values & key troubles:==
- Well-being: when some values are cherished and no threat is felt to them. 
- Crisis: when some values are cherished, but a threat is felt.
- Total panic: when all values cherished are threatened. 
- Uneasiness/anxiety: when the individual is not aware of any values, but feels threatened.
	- Indifference: when the individual is not aware of any values, and is unaware of a threat.
