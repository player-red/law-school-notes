(pg 47-71)
- '[[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Family\|Family]]' and 'household' boundaries are completely imagined. 
- What are the definitions of family and household, and what functions do they serve in India?

Mobilizing the Disintegrating Joint Family Discourse
- Care for elderly is often explained by family structure and values: saying that the joint family system is the one that ensures this care.
- There is a growing belief that the joint family system is on the decline due to [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Modernization\|Modernization]] and industrialization and the increase in nuclear families. 
- According to Census data, there is no reduction in the number of individuals per family.
- Similarity between Indian and European family sizes seen as an achievement, promoted by social reformers, as the joint family was seen as an obstacle to progress.
- The introduction of the 'Hindu joint family' created the property-holding joint family with clear relations between family members, making the senior male the head.
	- Narrative of keeping family and property together created.
	- Attacked separation of families, despite the fact that the joint family requires it.
		- Assumption 1: a family *will* separate.
		- Assumption 2: a joint household has three generations.

Politics and family discourse
- Politics of family can:
	- Oppress the population
	- Punish individual behaviour
	- Justify distribution of resources
	- Stigmatize families
- Caused due to generalizations based on the ideal model of a vocal, privileged minority. 
- British administrators promoted the nuclear family, since it was seen as the ideal for producing good workers for capitalism.
	- Joint families were seen as producing "drones" instead, and discouraged.
	- The logic behind this was that if newly independent nations copied Western nations' social structures, they would somehow be able to replicate their economic successes.
- Indologists created the myth of the traditional Hindu joint family, excluding Muslims by positioning them as outsiders, same as the Britishers.
- Criteria used to define joint family:
	- Karve: cohabitation, including messing together and holding property in common.
	- Census: cohabitation - having one hearth and front door.
	- Gupta: chose mutual obligations instead of cohabitation. 
	- Thomas: argued that Gupta's joint families should have been classified as nuclear.
	- Desai: found out that the definition of a nuclear family can vary from 32-85%. 
	- Desai and Khatri: degree of jointness according to the flow of people, material goods and decision-making agency.
	- Inefficacy of the Census in defining family and degrees of jointness.

Senior citizen pension policy
- Extremely limited in that it was limited to a certain number of heads per household, and people per district no matter how many people qualified.
- Pension provided extremely low, became lower especially due to inflation. 
- Introduced Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.
	- Created Maintenance Tribunals, in order to claim a monthly allowance from adult children/those that will inherit property from a senior citizen. 
	- Forcing adult children to pay maintenance rather than creating welfare schemes, creating a moral imperative that adult children would be shamed for if not followed.
	- Said that people should fall back on their extended family for help, government shifting responsibility from itself onto citizens. 
	- Two problems unaddressed: capacity of younger people to take care of older people + older people not having any children/anyone to inherit/anything to pass on left destitute.
- Census statistic: 4.8% of people over sixty live alone, 9.8% with another over sixty.
	- Tells us nothing about financial support received, proximity to family, intergenerational support, etc. 
	- Creation of a narrative that says this is abandonment.

- Ignoring India's economic conditions: most people are working long hours for low wages and no pensions, supporting dependents unable to work is next to impossible.
	- NOT a symptom of failing family values, rather a failure of the government to support the elderly and provide the means to families to support their elderly.

- Scope of the Act increased:
	- Can evict blood relatives/legal heirs regardless of whether the property is ancestral or self-acquired.
	- Can evict widowed daughters-in-law.

Cultural values: What is culture?
- Practice may vary, but values and beliefs are retained.
- Different understandings of 'joint', 'nuclear', 'family', 'household', 'looking after', 'living with'.
- Often younger people depending on older people. 

Local level family-based discourse
1. Defining household boundaries
	- Contextually understood, creates limitations in the Census definition. 
	- Meaning of joint: based on family unity, income, legal status of property, etc.
	- Census assumes that every person has one identified home and always lives there.
	- Assumes that households are self-sufficient.
2. Fudging the household boundary
	- Assumption made by public discourse: everyone has a functioning household - ignores how inequality impacts the lives of people, economically and socially.
	- Some cannot start or join households, given temporary access to others' households (not as equals).
	- [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]]: 'Paying guests': works well for men, since they are out most of the day working and socializing. However, women spend most of their time in the household, acutely aware of their situation and trying to help with domestic chores & childcare while earning outside. Similarly, young people tend to be better off as compared to older people.
