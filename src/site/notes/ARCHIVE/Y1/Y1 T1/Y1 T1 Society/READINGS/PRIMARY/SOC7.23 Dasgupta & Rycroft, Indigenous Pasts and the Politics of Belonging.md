(pg 1-14)

- Adivasi subjectivity: cannot be defined through the word tribe, has to include historical context including de-colonization.
	- Most Adivasi communities had vastly different experiences with colonialism, hence there are multiple Adivasi subjectivities. 
- 'Adivasi' (Hindi) means original inhabitants of a place.
	- Used to refer to different people in different places.
	- First used in Jharkhand when the Adivasi Mahasabha was created in 1938.
	- Now translated as Indigenous and Tribal Peoples to be part of the transnational Indigenous movement.
- Racial and cultural distinctiveness gained recognition due to anti-colonial movements.
- Subaltern societies gained recognition and some customary laws in the post-Emergency period. 
- Helping Adivasi communities express their community consciousness and build a political foundation.

Beyond tribal studies
- Many authors often conflate 'tribe' and 'Adivasi', erasing the nuance of the latter.
- Risley's definition of a tribe: collection of families sharing the same name (no specific occupation), claiming descent from a mythical ancestor or animal.
	- Distinguished from [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Caste\|Caste]] and religion, instead made the term 'tribe' a definable object.
	- Ethnographic texts contradicted this, giving a variety of ideas of a tribe and then back to one fixed identity. 
- To codify land rights, colonial policy and ethnography developed and finally separated. 
	- It was during this time that caste and tribe were separated.
	- Category of tribe kept being modified to suit the situation. 
	- Always othered from the rest of the population (hill- and forest-dwellers vs plain-dwellers, aboriginals vs Hindus, animists vs polytheists, etc.) - [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Othering\|Othering]].
	- Notion of tribes as primitive also internalized by modernist Indian thinkers, attempts to diverge from highlighting racial typography resulted in perpetuating primitivist tendencies.
	- Sarat Chandra Roy simply presented 'tribal' cultures as fully separate from Hindu civilization. 
- [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/André Béteille\|André Béteille]] pointed out the fact that India is a unique case, and that tribes and other social organizations need to be recognized without using a textbook definition of a tribe. 
- Devalle, Skaria and Guha argued that a 'tribe' is a colonial category with no grounded reasoning, originating in colonial theories and practices.

- De-coloniality: moving beyond colonial and post-colonial patterning. 
	- Describes the transition between de-colonisation and post-coloniality.

The politics of belonging
- The Adivasi identity still has to replace the 'tribal' label in India.
	- The notion that Adivasi people are tribal is upheld by the 5th and 6th Schedule of the Constitution. 
	- Often takes precedence over the 'indigenous' part of Adivasi identity.
- Includes many different geographical identities: regional, state-level, international.
