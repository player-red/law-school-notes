- Wrote the landmark book, '[[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]] Trouble' (1990) about [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]].
- Following [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Simone de Beauvoir\|Simone de Beauvoir]]'s idea that one has to become a woman, all of us learn to become men and women, ie perform our gender roles. 
- This leads to idea of [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Performativity\|Performativity]]: an innate quality all of us express in the form of gender roles.
- The [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Heterosexual Matrix\|Heterosexual Matrix]] constructed by institutions, practices and discourses is the idea that there are only two biological sexes, male and female, of which each experience sexual desire for only the opposite. 
	- Removal will lead to the idea that sexual orientations, gender, etc are fluid
