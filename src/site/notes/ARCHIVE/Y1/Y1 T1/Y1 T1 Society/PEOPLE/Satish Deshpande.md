Views of modernity and modernization:
- constantly explored through the lens of what is 'traditional' 
- extremely desirable (for non-Western countries colonized by Western countries), since colonial marks could be erased and they could feel equal to their former colonial masters.
- 'Tradition' and 'modernity' work in tandem: if one is present, another party is compensating.
	- If a man is 'modern', a woman may be 'traditional'.
