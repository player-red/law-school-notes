Introduction: The Varieties of Rules (pp. 1-16)

TYPES OF RULES
1. Normative/Prescriptive
	- Used to guide, control and change the behaviour of agents
	- Do not describe anything
	- Can change or prevent change
	1. Instructions
		- Optional rules that help you reach a goal/outcome.
		- Can be plausibly avoided.
		- We follow them only if we believe they will lead us to the desired outcome (no belief = force of the rule disappears)
		- Supplies a reasoning for doing/not doing something
	2. Mandatory rules
		- Rules that exert normative pressure and cannot be avoided, only violated.
		- Say what "should" or "ought" to be done.
		- Categorical in nature.
   
2. Descriptive 
	- EX: "German wine is sweeter than French"
	- describe and explain the world/facts of the situation
	- cannot change anything

| Constitutive Rules                                                    | Regulatory Rules                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create the possibility of behaviour                                   | Govern previously existing behaviour                               |
| Define behaviour, without which it would not exist                    | Behaviour already defined independent of rule                      |
| First defines/creates behaviour, only then is it possible to regulate | Applies pressure by prohibiting, requiring or permitting behaviour |

The logic of norms
- Strength of rules:
	- Derived from how harsh the sanction is for violating the rule (prohibition)
	- Or from how appealing the reward is for following the rule (permission/compulsion)

Rules and law:
- Regulatory rules exist outside of the law as well.
- Rule-based decision making is a subset of legal decision making. 

Some problems of terminology:
- Sometimes, the word 'principle' is used in place of the word 'rule' to avoid the technicality that a 'rule' carries.
