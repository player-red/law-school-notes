An exploration of the Constitution through three different cases: 
- The deprioritization of the ending of bonded labour
- The steps taken to end manual scavenging
- The inhumane nature of the anti-beggary law

Bonded labour
- The Bonded Labour Act, 1976, derived from Article 23 — asserts right against exploitation. 
	- Abolishes the system of bonded labour.
	- Releases from the debt of repayment.
	- Does not recognize non-payment of minimum wages as bondage: as a result, bonded labour flourishes in a different form due to the denial of the law. 

Manual scavengers
- Article 17 abolished the practice of untouchability with the introduction of the Constitution in 1950. 
- Using Article 252(1), the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act 1993 was passed, along with support from the state legislations of multiple states. 
- Parliament finally recognized the need to abolish manual scavenging and to have a uniform legislation in order to do so. Also established National Commission for Safai Karamcharis in the same year. 
- The presence of [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Caste\|Caste]] tensions was undeniable, and addressed by Narayanamma, who worked as a manual scavenger, as work that was forced upon the "untouchable" caste.
- Safai Karamchari Andolan became a movement with the goal of eradicating manual scavenging. 
- Padayatras held to demolish dry latrines. 
- The ending of this practice needs the workers themselves to withdraw, which is difficult since they are trained to believe that it is their role in society. 
- Indian Railways continued to hire manual scavengers, and refused to change its system despite the disapproval of the law.

Anti-beggary laws
- Begging first was seen as a nuisance, now as a crime. 
- The constitutional protections given to an accused are also missing. 
- The Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, became a model act for other states to adopt as well. It defines begging as simply suffering from poverty and punishes it through a 'summary trial' and detention. 
- By criminalizing poverty and taking away constitutional protections from the poor, it enables excesses on the part of the State and sets a dangerous precedent, especially for arrests without warrant and inhuman treatment of the poor — multiple deaths unexplained, in unhygienic conditions.
