[[Y1 T2 Torts/CONCEPTS/Damnum sine injuria\|Damnum sine injuria]] – the actions of the defendants caused damage to the plaintiff, but there was no illegality on their part, per the rule of competition. (Underbidding, low prices, exclusivity contracts, 5% rebate, etc.)

Plaintiff argued that the anti-competition actions taken by the defendants were against public policy, and that their motives were malicious, a conspiracy. Agreements in restraint of trade are void and the performance of such is an unlawful act.

Just because something feels morally wrong does not mean a new doctrine should come about to fix it. The law does not dictate morals but rather keeps order. Considered not to be a case of conspiracy by the court.
