An omission is wrongful when a duty to act exists and that duty is breached. 

According to Brown, 
A voluntary act includes:
(1) a willed muscular contraction
(2) its circumstances
(3) its consequences
Does not account for omissions, and 'willed' is a dubious term that is difficult to prove in a court of law. 

2.3 Mental elements of a tort

Malice
- Intentional doing of a wrongful act: ==malice in law==/implied malice
	- done wrongfully without reasonable or probable cause
- Improper motive: express malice/==malice in fact==/actual malice
	- Relevant to malicious prosecution

Intention, Negligence and Recklessness
- Intention: internal fact
	- What a person thinks can only be inferred from actions.
	- Intentional act: knowledge of the result of an act, and desire of the result of an act.
- Negligence: consequences of an act not adverted when they could have been reasonably foreseen.
- Recklessness: commission or omission of an act without regard for the consequences despite being aware that they might happen, taking large risks without regard for the safety of others. 
	- Called gross negligence sometimes. 

Motive
- Purpose behind doing an act.
- How it differs from intention:
	- Intention: immediate objective, motive: ulterior objective
	- Intention: may not be related to actor, motive: personal benefit derived from doing an act

Malfeasance, Misfeasance, Nonfeasance
- Malfeasance: commission of an unlawful act
	- Usually refers to acts that are actionable per se and do not require proof of intention/motive
- Misfeasance: improper performance of a lawful act (negligence)
- Nonfeasance: omission of an act when there is an obligation to perform it

Fault
- Some torts do not require the element of fault in order to prove liability (strict liability).
