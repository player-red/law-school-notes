Filed as a [[Y1 T1 Legal Methods/CONCEPTS/Special Leave Petition\|Special Leave Petition]] under [[Y1 T1 Legal Methods/CONSTITUTION/Article 136\|Article 136]].

Paragraph 26: Using [[Y1 T1 Legal Methods/CONSTITUTION/Article 12\|Article 12]] and the Ajay Hasnia case, the court states that the Cooperative Society is not the State, and the society takes precedence over the individual.
- Thus, the court eliminates the use of Article 15, which says that "the **State** shall not discriminate".

- Do articles 14 and 15 have primacy over article 19?
- Right of minorities to preserve themselves vs fundamental freedoms?
- Reasonable restrictions

- Damyanti Naranga: held that associations have the right to admit who they please to voluntarily
- Daman Singh: ruled that cooperative societies are ruled by statutes which can be subject to interference by the rules of the statute.
