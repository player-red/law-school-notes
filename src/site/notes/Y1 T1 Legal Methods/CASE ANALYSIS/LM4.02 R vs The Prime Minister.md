Petitioner's arguments:
- Legal arguments/principles/rules: Parliament and judiciary can review actions of the legislative, unconstitutional action taken by PM, arbitrary length of time
- Any other arguments advanced were moral and not taken into consideration.

Respondent's arguments:
- Justiciability challenged, customary rules, law doesn't impose any standards, positivist claim, judicial overreach (beyond judicial review), judicial standard of law will be created.
- If this case is decided, length of prorogation will be decided, and that would be a violation of the separation of powers.

COURT'S STANCE: cannot judge the reason, but can judge the action itself.

Legal issues:
1. Whether the PM's advice to the Queen was lawfully justiciable in a court?
	- Yes: executive power is not absolute, even the King is bound by law.
2. By what standard is lawfulness to be judged?
	- Limit is not defined, but it is limited and has to be compatible with common law principles.
3. Was the advice lawful?
	- It was unlawful, as it prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role.
	- If there was reasonable justification, it would be lawful.
4. Was Parliament prorogued or not?
	- No.
