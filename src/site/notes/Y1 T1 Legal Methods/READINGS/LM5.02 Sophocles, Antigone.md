Prologue

- Divine law (natural law) vs law of the state/positive law
- Morality vs authority
- Antigone: wanted to follow divine law by burying the dead, whereas the authority forbade his burial 
	- In this case, the authority's law is the command of the sovereign. 
- Antigone portrayed irrational and emotional for following natural human rights, similar to human rights activists of today. 
- Ismene conflates the rule of law with the rule of the sovereign by believing the law the sovereign creates is made for the public good and must be followed.
	- In doing so, she is giving up her freedom to follow the will of the sovereign.
