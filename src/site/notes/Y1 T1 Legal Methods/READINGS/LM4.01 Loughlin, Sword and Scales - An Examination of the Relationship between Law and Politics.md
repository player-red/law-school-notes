Chapter 1 (pp. 9-12)

What is Law?
- Doesn't have a proper, satisfying definition. (Prof. HLA Hart)
- Rather will set out to define 3 proper ideas of law.

Law as an instrument of government
- The State establishes order by creating laws.
- Hobbes & John Austin.
- Austin's thoughts:
	- Law is comprised of the commands of ultimate political authority (person or body).
	- Output of a political process (voting by representatives in a democracy). - Product of politics.
- Greek view
	- Law establishes the structure in which political action can be taken. 
	- Unlike Austin's view, it says that law is the background for politics.
	- Theory of natural law and justice associated with this view. 
	- Since nature followed its laws, humans also followed their innate morals due to their ability make rational and logical decisions.
		- Often links to theology and God-given reasoning. 
			- Avoided by modern natural rights theorists.
	- Hugo Grotius said that laws remain valid even if there is no God, and argued for two different conceptions of law:
		- Reason
		- Tradition

Law as tradition/custom:
- English law follows constantly evolving common law for the people. 
- Idea that law is discovered and declared, not made.
- Since tradition is "unbroken", law is put on a pedestal. 
- Idea that law is a set of guiding principles.

Law as reason/right:
- Grotius first to frame law as a set of rights.
- Law as a form of science based on logical reasoning, placing it on a pedestal.
- Idea that law is different from and superior to politics.
	- KANT - Politics must treat rights as superior.
- Judiciary is separate from the political conflicts of society.
- Dworkin says that political issues are sometimes converted into legal issues.

Chapter 14 (pp. 217-227)

Law as custom
- Knowledge is not acquired through theory or analysis, but through education in tradition.
- Law evolves naturally, like language.
- Conventional practices are guarded by judges.
- Interpret traditions and do not talk about loaded political questions.
- Defer to the executive's authority to govern, since fixed legal rules do not remove the need for executive action.
- State as a mechanism to handle political conflicts.

Law as command
- After the Industrial Revolution, tradition was replaced by legislation and codification. 
- First voiced by Hobbes — law is the command of the those who possess sovereign power.
- Human will expressed through the sovereign (State).
- Representative democracy — law legitimizes government.
- Tensions between the law and politics created due to the continuation of aristocratic rule which thinks of the masses as naive and overambitious. 

Law as right
- Argue laws are normative statements with good reasoning for being obeyed.
- Natural law is a set of objective moral principles discovered through reasoning.
- Duty is not necessary.
- Maintenance of freedom and law are connected.
- View politics as an activity in which personal opinions sway from what is morally, objectively good.
- Law must guide and place politics in boundaries.
- Establishes preconditions for the activity of politics (basically Greek view of law).

Conceptions of law in political practice
- The language of law can be compared to an ancient city as it is busy and constantly evolving over time. 
- Reflects the practicality of law. 
- Functions of politics remain rooted.
- The struggle over the meaning of law is in itself a political struggle.
