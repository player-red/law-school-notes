Of Rules in General (pp. 80-97)

What is a rule?
- A general norm mandating or guiding conduct in a specific situation. 
- It is normative and not concerned with description. 
- It is general: concerns types of behaviour in certain types of situations. 
	- A norm for a unique event is not a rule.
- Guide and serve as standards for human behaviour. 
- Provide a reason for taking an action/committing omission. 

Some complexities:
- Prudential prescription vs normative prescription: 
	- Prudential: provides means to an end, can be moral or immoral.
	- Normative: a judgment about moral conduct, defines what is good and bad.
- Dworkin's idea of rules:
	- Rules:
		- All or nothing.
		- If it is valid, it dictates the result of a scenario.
	- Principles:
		- Guiding standards, do not necessarily dictate the result of a scenario.
	- Policies:
		- Standards that set a goal to be achieved.
- Author disagrees with Dworkin's idea of rules and principles, saying the former are too specific and the latter too general.

| Habit                                           | Rule                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| factual generalizations capable of verification | normative principles that prescribe behaviour (ought, should, can, must) |

| Prediction                   | Rule                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General or particular        | General                                                                            |
| Must be either true or false | Describe and prescribe actions in a situation, can be used as an aid to prediction |

| Command                                     | Rule (often expressed in the form of commands)                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Some lack generality                        | General                                                                           |
| Direct expressions of the will of authority | Some may or may not command, can also authorise, criticise and evaluate behaviour |

Rules and values
- In some cases, the rule represents the means and the value the end: 
	- A rule can further, embody or conflict with a value.
	- It can act as a compromise between two conflicting values. 
	- EXAMPLE: Safety of road travelers vs Convenience and traffic progress (values): Governing road traffic laws (rules)
- Types of values
	- Moralist/deontological: abstract principles that are inherently good. (KANT)
	- Utilitarian/consequentialist: effects of the action maximizing welfare or other consequences deemed to be good. (BENTHAM)
	- Ethical pluralism: mixture of consequentialist and moralist.

The form and structure of a rule 
- Rule vs verbal formulation of a rule
	- Many rules are unspoken, especially social ones.
	- Grammatical expression of rules can change the effect.
	  ==If X,== then Y
	  Protasis, apodosis
	  The protasis includes the type of situation and the type of rule (who is governed by it, the type of behaviour, conditions under which it applies), whereas the apodosis states whether the type of behaviour regulated is allowed or prohibited.
- Relationship between rules and sanctions:
	- Some rules are backed by sanctions.
	- The sanction can be part of the apodosis or as a separate rule entirely (latter is preferred).
		- When it is part of a separate rule, the apodosis of rule 1 becomes the protasis of rule 2.
