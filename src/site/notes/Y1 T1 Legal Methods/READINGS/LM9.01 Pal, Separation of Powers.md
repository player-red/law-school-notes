Chapter 15 in The Oxford Handbook of the Indian Constitution

Introduction
- Definition of power:
	- Seervai's definition: power is a means to an end, and must be given to the authority that can achieve this end. (Mistaken belief: power is property)
	- Hence, 'separation of powers' means specialization of functions.
- Montesquieu's idea:
	- Monopoly of power, however defined, by any organ defined by the Constitution (written or unwritten), leads to tyranny. 
	- Hence, separation of powers is necessary in a constitutional setup, with each organ checking the others. 
- Indian context:
	- Is separation of powers a principle in Indian constitutional law?
	- Which doctrine of separation of powers does the Indian constitution use?

- Areas of governance
	- Executive
	- Judiciary
	- Legislative 
- Models of separation of powers:
	1. Rigid separation (Montesquieu)
		- American Constitution: all three organs are kept as separate from each other as possible.
		- Each arm has the power to hold the other accountable. 
	2. Looser separation - Westminster model 
		- Follows the doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament - judiciary can exercise judicial review on only scope of delegation and reasonability of law.
		- Legislative and executive separated, but kept in close association - the Cabinet joins the two organs. 
	3. Indian Constitution
		- Recognizes the three organs of state, but does not expressly state which powers are vested in which organ - no exclusivity in the nature of their functions. 
		- Parliament is not supreme and is limited by the Constitution - any legislation going against the spirit of the Constitution is void.
		- Executive given dominant powers - no real separation between the executive and the legislative. 
		- Wide powers of judicial review means the judiciary often carries out quasi-legislative and executive functions. 

==The Legislature==
- Indian constitutionalism rejected the supremacy of the legislature, opting instead for Constitutional supremacy. 
- Still, Parliament exercises control over the judiciary in various ways:
	- Deciding the number of judges per court, the jurisdiction of the court in different states, salaries and terms of judges.
	- Can remove judges through impeachment. 
1. Judicial powers
	- Impeachment of judges and holding people responsible for contempt of legislatures.
	- Can change the law, ie the basis on which a judgment is given, thus nullifying the judgement. 
2. Legislative control of judiciary
	- To limit the power of judicial review, Article 31B allowed the violation of fundamental rights and prohibited any challenges to these violations for provisions under the Ninth Schedule. 
	- Formation of tribunals (part of 42nd Amendment) - the Parliament has the power to create them and exclude the jurisdiction of the Courts on these subjects. 
	- Power to impeach judges reserved by Parliament. 

==The Executive==
1. Legislative Powers
	- Bills originate with the executive, though the legislature is the one with duty to formulate laws under Article 245.
	- Power of the legislature to delegate: cannot delegate power that would amount to abdication. 
	- Conditional legislation: extension of law to cover areas that it was not previously covering through notification. 
	- Ordinances: same force as a law made by Parliament (Article 123).
	- President's rule: Article 356 - acting on the advice of the Executive, the President is empowered to rule a state and dissolve its legislative assembly. Any laws declared during the Emergency period remain valid till altered or repealed by legislature. 
2. Judicial powers
	- Disqualification of a member of Parliament. 
	- Inquiry into charges against any person holding a civil post. 
	- Administrative tribunals under Articles 323A and 323B.
3. Executive control of judiciary
	- President can decide the number of judges to be appointed to HCs, and who may be appointed to SC and HC (final decision).
	- Can control the appointment and service conditions of district judges. 
	- Can prosecute judges for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.

==The Judiciary==
1. Judicial power and independence
	- Wide powers of judicial review in order to hold other two organs accountable. 
	- Given in order to balance dominance of executive and legislative majority. 
	- Led to attacks on judicial independence by executive and legislature, and assertion of judicial independence by judiciary. 
	- Secured independence from other two organs by prescribing the collegium system for the appointment of judges, only leaving the final decision up to the President, in consultation with the Chief Justice of SC/HC. 
2. Judicial control of legislature
	- Constantly watching for provisions that reduce the power or jurisdiction of the judiciary.
	- Exercise interpretation of the Constitution and legislation created, and restrict legislation to the basic structure of the Constitution (Kesavananda Bharati).
	- Due process of law ([[Y1 T1 Legal Methods/CONSTITUTION/Article 14\|Article 14]], [[Y1 T1 Legal Methods/CONSTITUTION/Article 21\|Article 21]]) - allows the courts to supervise and invalidate any action taken by the State.
3. Judicial control of the executive
	- Usually does not interfere in matters of policy, but it can set up committees to monitor the implementation of any directives it issues. 

<h5>Autonomous bodies</h5>
- Required to be independent of the legislature and executive.

1. Election commission 
	- Supposed to be free from any interference from the executive, since it is the body that handles elections. 
	- Parliament can make laws pertaining to it as long as it does interfere with basic provisions, cannot do so during the process of election. 
2. Comptroller and auditor general
	- Most important officer in the Constitution — [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Dr B. R. Ambedkar\|Dr B. R. Ambedkar]]'s opinion. 
	- Cannot examine expenditure before it is decided, and hence cannot regulate freebies promised by political parties. 
	- Appointed on recommendation of PM by President — not as independent as the judiciary. 
	- Not assured of tenure and cannot independently select officers and servants.
	- Cannot take action on its own report, making it possible for the executive to disregard any objections made.
