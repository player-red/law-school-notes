Scene 1

- Some people prefer certainty and stability of law over broad claims of justice.
- Justice and law balance each other out. 
- Rule of law vs rule of ruler
	- Dangerous to have unchecked rule of ruler, since who would check the power of the State in such a case?
- Rule of law: equality before law, no one is above the law.
- Equality before law (formal equality) vs equal protection of law (substantive equality)
