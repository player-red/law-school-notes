Finding the Way Out of the Desert

|                     | Separation of disciplines | Integration of scientific methods |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Legal questions     | Basic                     | Advanced (type 2)                 |
| Non-legal questions | Advanced (type 1)         | Advanced (type 3)                 |

Basic interdisciplinary research
- Legal questions + separated disciplines
- Researcher may be interested in:
	- micro-legal question: specific concept or provision in a code.
	- macro-legal question: general concepts of law.
- Other disciplines are required since traditional legal research is too narrow.
- Inclusion of other disciplines means research could be more balanced and informed.
- Problems:
	- Too impractical and too difficult.
	- Produces abstract/theoretical works with barely any scope for application in the real world. 
		- Siems says that these are not strong objections.
	- Subordinate character of other disciplines can lead to problems - not adequately understanding/misunderstanding the other discipline can invalidate the research. 

Advanced Interdisciplinary Research: Type 1
- Non-legal questions + separated disciplines 
- EX: developing strong capital markets (law is just one factor), how to tackle climate change (legal aspects - developing the law, policies, signing of treaties, etc.)
- Advantages: relatively comprehensive view of a topic, does not focus on only one small part of the problem, rather looks at interconnected issues.
- Disadvantage: requires acquiring of knowledge about other fields, or collaboration with researchers from other fields. The way universities are currently structured, knowledge is siloed and difficult for people from other disciplines to access.

Advanced Interdisciplinary Research: Type 2
