Finding the Way Out of the Desert

|                     | Separation of disciplines | Integration of scientific methods |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Legal questions     | Basic                     | Advanced (type 2)                 |
| Non-legal questions | Advanced (type 1)         | Advanced (type 3)                 |

Basic interdisciplinary research
- Legal questions + separated disciplines
- Researcher may be interested in:
	- micro-legal question: specific concept or provision in a code.
	- macro-legal question: general concepts of law.
- Other disciplines are required since traditional legal research is too narrow.
- Inclusion of other disciplines means research could be more balanced and informed.
- Problems:
	- Too impractical and too difficult.
	- Produces abstract/theoretical works with barely any scope for application in the real world. 
		- Siems says that these are not strong objections.
	- Subordinate character of other disciplines can lead to problems - not adequately understanding/misunderstanding the other discipline can invalidate the research. 

Advanced Interdisciplinary Research: Type 1
- Non-legal questions + separated disciplines
