Introduction (pp. 1-15)

- Basis for Indian Constitutionalism:
	- Limit or structure for the daily lives of common citizens.
	- Many ordinary Indians, especially those from marginalized and subaltern communities, engaged with the Constitution due to the newfound accessibility of the Courts and the law.
	- Many constitutional encounters came about due to the regulation of markets by the Indian State. 

- The Constitution is not simply a document created by the elites to govern the people, but is also affected by the aspirations and demands of the people. 
- It exists in a normative universe, and uses the interpretive powers of the Courts to distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad. 

Views of the Constitution:
- As a Triumph:
	- A gift from the Indian elite to everyone else, a document for social change and the uplifting of oppressed classes. 
	- A masterstroke of sorts that united all people in India under one single banner.
- As an Illusion:
	- [[Y1 T1 Legal Methods/READINGS/LM1.01 Manto, The New Constitution\|LM1.01 Manto, The New Constitution]]: a spectacle made about a new Constitution, but the gap between reality and ideal was not bridged. 
	- An easily amended document that could quickly lose its original purpose.
	- An imitation of Western Constitutions which would not resonate with a vast majority of Indians. 

- The book promotes neither view, but insists that the Constitution transformed daily life in India. 
	- Gave a voice to marginalized sections of society who were then able to lead social change through the Constitution. 
	- Due to writ petitions, a speedier form of justice was available to the people.
