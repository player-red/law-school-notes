Abstract
- Populism is inherently dependent on the culture in which it arises, making those who want to study it compulsorily comparativist.
- It is situated within democracy and uses the principles of democracy (the nation and the people) to favour one subset of people over another. 

Introduction
- At first seen as a problem, now it is seen as an opportunity to revitalize democracy. 
- It is an ambiguous term because it is neither an ideology nor a political regime, and it can take various forms depending on when and where.
- Incompatible with forms of politics that are nondemocratic.
- Based on exclusion.
- Can stretch constitutional democracy and create more authoritarian forms of government, including dictatorship.
- Like a parasite to democracy.
- No actual theory of populism.
- Uses associations and partisan affiliations to influence opinion.
- Electoral representation creates a gap between people as providers of legitimacy and the people as a social reality.
	- Populism claims to fill this gap.
	- However, the people are represented by one leader rather than themselves. Direct self-government does not exist under populism. 
	- Laclau argues that all populist regimes take the name of the leader. 
- Under populism, democratic legitimacy becomes the possession of a small group, which the leader uses against minorities and the opposition.
- 'Populism in power is an extreme majoritarianism.'
- Tries to occupy the space of and modify the constitution. 

Contexts and Comparisons
- Populism can take many different forms: religious, secular, nationalist, patriotic, indigeneity, etc.
- Originally a reaction against modernization, from a collectivist, agrarian group of intellectuals (Russia), then citizens questioning the ruling elites in the name of their Constitution (USA).
- In the USA and Canada, it served to include the common people in the political sphere, at a time when elected representatives were part of an oligarchy. 
	- Helped bring about redistribution of power.
- In Latin America, it favoured the middle class, stifled dissent and implemented welfare policies while protecting traditional values. 
- Shows qualities belonging to both democracy and fascism.
- Does not suspend free and competitive elections, since electoral legitimacy of the leader is one of its key features.

Interpretations
- Scholarship on populism has two types:
	1. Circumstances and social conditions of populism (political history and comparative social studies)
	2. Populism as a concept, its nature and characteristics (political theory and conceptual history)
Two theories: minimal and maximal.
Minimalist Theory
- All ideological tropes, political style. and strategies devised by leaders to achieve power.
- This is to include all experiences of populism. 
- Mudde believed it considers society to be split into two homogenous groups, and argues that politics should be an expression of the general will. 
	- The dualism of commons vs the elites dates back to ancient Rome, and is not unique to populism. 
- Ideological and stylistic approaches.
	- Does not differentiate antiestablishment populism from the traditional republican paradigm. 
- Strategy of a personalistic leader using uninstitutionalized support.
	- Judges by the outcome instead of its effects on democratic institutions.
	- Does not properly distinguish between representative democracy and populism.
Maximal Theory
- Explicit connection between populism and democracy.
- The 'people' is a construct based on how a leader can mobilize dissatisfied groups projected as underdogs by the elite.
- Wants to use the power of the State to repress dissent from opposition. 

A Theory of Populism in Power
- Minimal and Maximal theories both stress on one feature and reduce the complexity of populism. 
- Introduces a distinction between two types of populism:
	1. Movement of opinion: oppositional populism, not interested in creating a representative constituency.
	2. Movement that strives to become a ruling power in the State. 
- Main argument: populism is a transmutation of democracy and not a complete exit from democracy. 
- The main leader need not be exactly like those who they claim to represent, but can also be an aspiration of the majority they represent.
	- They need not be morally pure or saint-like, since the majority itself recognizes that it is not pure either.
- Democratic practice means having multiple rulers and representatives, something routinely ignored by populism.
- Populist leaders use elections as confirmation of the 'authentic' people's support, and treat the opposition as a foreign enemy.
- Uses the narrative of bringing the 'forgotten' or 'true' country back. 
- The leader bypasses intermediaries and appears to be in 'direct' communication with the people. 
- Populism in power = permanent electoral campaign.
- Populism does not build trust on the idea of accountability to the people, rather bases it on the faith of the people. 

- Populism glorifies one part of the people, hence is pars pro parte (a part taken for a part), not pars pro toto (a part taken for the whole).
- It openly rules for its own good and for the glorified part. 
- Democracy becomes a regime OF the majority, instead of a regime BY the majority.
- Hence, it cannot be associated with Rousseau's general will ([[Y1 T2 Power/READINGS/POW13.01 Rousseau, The Social Contract\|POW13.01 Rousseau, The Social Contract]]) because it only cares about the will of a certain part. 
- The dualism between the glorified part and the establishment it is fighting against (Montesquieu) is the spirit of populism.
