By James Farr.
- 1874-1958.
- American university professor 

Objectives of this reading:
- To understand why we must take language seriously in the context of political concepts and conceptual change.
- What a concept is and how it is different from a problem as James Farr sees it.
- To be able to sketch some limits of conceptual thinking.
- To be able to articulate how conceptual histories help us imagine alternative pasts and futures.

Definition of conceptual change:
- An imaginative consequence of political actors criticizing and attempting to resolve the contradictions which they discover or generate in the complex web of their beliefs, actions and practices as they try to understand and change the world around them. 
- It is the only constant thing about our political concepts.
- The change of language through grammar and syntax is also a political one. 
- Needs a historical understanding. 

Part I
- Politics is indescribable without language.
	- It would be a world filled with silence, or one like [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]' state of nature.
	- However, Hobbes believed that language was simply a way of transferring internal thoughts to the external realm, and did not make the connection to political action and community. 
- Farr argues that language is not apolitical, and that it functions by using the interests, needs and powers of individuals both overtly and covertly.
	- It is put to use politically to obtain some ends, and is constituted by these ends along with the consequences of its use.
- 'Linguistic constitution of politics':
	1. Most political actions can only be carried out through the use of language.
	2. Part of political beliefs, actions and practices are constituted of concepts held by political actors.
- Linguistic + political actions assume that there are shared understandings between political actors.
	- These understandings are embedded in social and political practices.
	- Similar to [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]]?
	- There must be agreement about three things: (1) criteria for applying political concepts, (2) the range of things which these concepts refer to, (3) the range of attitudes these concepts express.
- Practice of a political concept leads to long-term consequences that cannot be predicted, which may lead to contradictions of the practice itself and its reconceptualization. 

Part II
- Conceptual change is NOT a reflection of political change.
- They must be understood simultaneously since they affect each other. 
- It is a result of political actors trying to resolve problems and inconsistencies in the world around them. 
- Concepts are never held or used in isolation: they are part of constellations of concepts which form belief systems.
- Hume: "the Heart of Man is made to reconcile Contradictions".
- Contradicting beliefs must be resolved by elimination, usually through negating an erroneous belief. 
	- Hence, criticism forms the basis of changing theories.
	- Contradictions themselves emerge because of the consequences of beliefs, or in the fallout of multiple contradictory beliefs and actions.

Part III
Limits of a mechanism to understand conceptual change:
- It is not only problems and contradictions that can trigger conceptual change, simply using the imagination and playing around with ideas can as well. 
- Some contradictions are willfully ignored or overlooked — in such a case, we must understand why they are not questioned.
- Some contradictions are only observed after change occurs.
Hence, conceptual histories must be used to understand how conceptual change works.

Part IV
- Explanation of the history of the conceptual change of the term 'fourth estate'.
- 'Hegemony': predominance of one state over another -> predominance of one class over another
	- Bad if predominance of bourgeoisie, good if predominance of proletariat.
