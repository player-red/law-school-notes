From Selections on Book II, Chapters I to VII (pp. 63-79).

Chapter i
- Only general will can direct the principles of the state to work for the common good. 
- When individual interests concur, society is established. (social bond)
- Hence, sovereignty, the exercise of general will, cannot be transferred to anyone. 
	- The general will cannot be delegated, though power can. 
- Tensions between individual and general will created due to their nature: individuals care more about their preferences, whereas general will leans towards equality. 
	- Hence, agreement between the two is not permanent.
- Will does not bind itself for the future nor consent to something that would harm the individual who exercises it. 
- When a master-subject relationship is created, the 'people' ceases to exist, and hence the sovereign authority does not exist either. 

Chapter ii
- Sovereignty cannot be divided. It is either the will of the people or it is not. 
- Instead, the different powers are divided. 
- Manifestations of the authority of the sovereign have been confused as acts of sovereignty.
	- Not a law, rather an application of the law.

Chapter iii 
- The general will always tends to public welfare and is always in the right.
- However, decisions made by the people are not always in the right. 
- You cannot always see what is good for you, and you may be led astray into desiring the bad. 
- Will of everyone = sum total of individual wants. 
  General will = common interest (Will of everyone minus excesses and insufficiencies.)
- Without communication between the members of the people, general will would arise from a large number of small differences (considering everyone is properly informed).
- When partial associations arise, the general will of these associations is formed, and differences become fewer and create less general results. 
	- Outcome is the prevalence of one particular opinion rather than many different ones. 
- To properly ascertain general will, partial society should not exist and each citizen must decide according to their own opinion. 

Chapter iv
- [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/State\|State]]/city is a collective person which exists due to the union of its members. 
- For conservation of this whole, a coercive force which allows it to control its parts must exist. 
- This 'body politic' holds absolute power over all of its members, and is directed by the general will. 
- Difference between rights of sovereign and citizen?
	- Each person transfers part of his power, goods and freedom to the State as part of the [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/Social Contract Theory\|Social Contract Theory]]. The sovereign alone can judge how important it is.
	- Citizen owes the state all services that are asked of him, as long as it has a valid reason to. 
	- These obligations are mutual. 
- Principle of equality of right: since everyone is bound to the same rules and obligations. 
	- Hence, all the acts of the general will must benefit all citizens. 
- Therefore, sovereign power cannot go beyond the limits of general agreements. 
	- By extension, particular decisions are outside the sovereign's jurisdiction. 
- Rousseau argues that living under these conditions is preferable and citizens are not truly giving up anything. Rather, they are taking part in a beneficial transfer. 
	- Assumes that previous mode of living is uncertain, and living under the sovereign brings certainty and safety. 

Chapter v
- Asks how individuals can transfer the right to dispose of their own lives to the sovereign, when it is a right that they themselves do not possess. 
	- It seems as if the commonsense of these thinkers believes that suicide is a moral wrong/something that individuals do not have the right to do: possibly because of their Christian beliefs?
- Then considers the life of the citizen to be a conditional gift from the State rather than a natural benefit. 
- A wrongdoer ceases to belong to society since he betrays it by attacking its rights and breaking the social contract.

Chapter vi
- Law cannot govern only one single individual.
- Laws are acts of general will, and are not unjust since people cannot be unjust towards themselves.
- Republic: a state ruled by laws. 

Chapter vii
- Must be able to change the nature of man. (basically deifies legislators?)
