Written by [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Nivedita Menon\|Nivedita Menon]], explaining the different conceptions of [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/Power\|Power]], and how it is a concept that is "essentially contested".

Robert Dahl's definition:
'A has power over B to the extent that A can get B to do something which B would not otherwise do.'
Assumptions: 
1. Attribute of an individual that can be used over others.
2. Domination over others, forcing unwilling individuals to do something.

These assumptions are challenged by various scholars:
- Marxists: attributed to society at a collective level, and that it is unequally distributed in a society with social classes. Labour power produced by the lower class is stolen by the upper.
- Feminists: patriarchal structures contributing to the systematic domination of men over women. 
- [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Hannah Arendt\|Hannah Arendt]]: power is enabling, and enhances capacity to do things through collective action - "power to, not power power over". It also enables people to act morally responsibly.

Other understandings of power:
- Talcott Parsons: power circulates just like money, and it is the means to ensure performance of political obligations. Both facilitative (getting things done) and systemic (part of a social power system).

- Steven Lukes and WB Gallie: Power is an "essentially contested" concept.
	- Concepts are inseparable from values. 
	- By expressing the meaning of a concept, you imbue values into it and devalue other concept by choosing one description over another. 
- Dimensions of political power:
	- To ensure a set of interests prevails over others (Dahl's interpretation).
	- To ensure some issues never come up for debate in the first place. Peter Bachrach and Morton Baratz argue that by only looking at the obvious, in situations where people seem to be equal, power may already have been exercised. 
	- Structural understanding of power: Steven Lukes explains that even people's interests may be shaped by those wielding power, similar to the Marxist understanding of power. (Similar to Gramsci's view on hegemony in [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/READINGS/PRIMARY/SOC1.03 Deshpande, Contemporary India - A Sociological View\|SOC1.03 Deshpande, Contemporary India - A Sociological View]].) Could be used to give legitimacy to the prevailing [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/State\|State]].
		- The hegemony in a nation creates a dominant ideology that influences the people and their [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]] ideas.
		- Real relationships (such as the cardinal directions) could not exist without the imagination of man. 
- Called "essentially contested" because some may disagree with the second and third dimensions. 

Power as Exploitation
Marxist understanding of power.
- Surplus production produced by one section appropriated by another section of the population: called exploitation. 
- In capitalist society, each individual is equal, but only in the eyes of the law (juridical equality). However, socioeconomic equality does not exist.
- Extraction of surplus value would take place through the use of force, called extra-economic coercion. 

Authority, Legitimacy and Hegemony
- Max Weber's ideas of authority:
	- Rational-legal
		- Similar to the modern bureaucratic state.
		- Rational justification of the exercise of power by people occupying positions of power.
	- Traditional
		- Due to historical and cultural reasons.
	- Charismatic
		- Individual cults, because of some or other quality possessed by them. 
- Another distinction: de facto and de jure authority
	- De facto: the people and institutions actually exercising power.
	- De jure: authority that has legal sanction.
- David Held questions the idea that obedience to rules/a system gives it legitimacy. 

Feminist theories of power
- The oppression and subjugation of women is not individual behaviour, but a societally sanctioned and systematic one.
	- The [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/Patriarchy\|Patriarchy]].
- It is possible for individual women to have some power, but not without limits set by the patriarchy. 
	- Women in such a system are defined in terms of their relationship to men. 

Foucault on power
- Power is not repressive: it does not prevent us from doing what we want.
- Instead, it is productive: produces identity and subjectivity. 
- Power controls through naming.
- Governmentality: the homogenization and organization of society by using bureaucratic machinery and classification of people. 
- A subject is created and subjected to classification and tracking through the identities created by classification. 
- Creates normalization, where each individual is forced to fit a dominant norm. 
- Knowledge is a function of power relations. 
	- Power produces knowledge.
- Three types of struggles against power:
	- Against ethnic/religious/social domination.
	- Against exploitation.
	- Against forms of subjection.
