----------------
Objectives of the reading:
- To understand how political theory is different from ideology, cosmology and other social sciences.
- To be aware of the types of political theory.
- To be aware of the functions of political theory.
- To learn how to study political theory. 

Meaning of 'political'
- State institutions
- To exercise power over someone
- Collective fight for interests and issues

Humans as concept-bearing animals
- All of us have some shared understanding of the world around us, through the use of concepts.
- Society functions through this use of [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]]. 
- This produces the lived experience, a step above the sensory experience.

Concepts embedded in practices
- Concepts are embedded through the unconscious practice of various activities.

Human expressions
- Expressions can be both internal and external.
- They can be brought about by the use of words, images, performance, etc.

Ad hoc and systematic reflections
- Random thoughts occur sometimes for no reason, other times due to an interruption in normal activity.

Word-dependent and word-independent reflections
- The exploration of a thought beyond its first occurrence, by using sustained enquiry. 
- Not necessary that this enquiry uses words.

Varieties of word-dependent reflections
- Theory is also a form of language-dependent systematic reflection. 
- It has six distinct features, four shared with philosophy and two unique.

Distinctiveness of theory
First feature: conceptual sensitivity
- Concern with the internal structure of concepts 
- How they relate to each other
- How they come in clusters ("constellations" - [[Y1 T2 Power/READINGS/POW1.01 Farr, Understanding Conceptual Change Politically\|POW1.01 Farr, Understanding Conceptual Change Politically]])
- How they mark their boundaries. 
Second feature: rational structure
- It is rational, and uses reason to arrive at a conclusion.
- Cannot have plain assertions without reasoning.
Third feature: aspiration for a humanly achievable truth & objectivity
- Aspires to be as truthful and objective as possible.
- However, it is impossible for human beings to escape subjectivity.
Fourth feature: a mandate to unearth assumptions and presuppositions
- Trying to unearth background biases, assumptions and presuppositions that support human belief, actions, practices, statements, etc.
Fifth feature: generality
- A theory aspires to have some degree of general application.
- Does not mean that theories have to be universal.
Sixth feature: strong non-speculative intent
- Must not be only speculative
- Must be verifiable using empirical data.

Cosmologies and common sense
- Embedded understanding: knowledge that is pre-reflective and has not yet been articulated.
- Commonsense covers embedded understanding, and also includes practical reflections and cosmologies that are formed as a result of non-theoretical (generally systematic) reflections.
- Argues that theories and commonsense must remain distinct: 
	- Commonsense is a collective possession.
	- Theorizing requires specific skills and activities. 
		- Does not mean that theory is restricted to the elite man, rather that it is available to anyone willing to spend time on it, as long as someone who has the opportunity to do it. 
- Similarly, theory and the arts are different in the respect that theory not only describes human practices, but also explains and justifies them, and endorses and modifies them. 

What is political?
- In ancient Greece, the art of decision-making in the city was carried out through persuasion and deliberation rather than violence ([[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Hannah Arendt\|Hannah Arendt]]).
	- [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/Power\|Power]] not exercised by everyone: women, slaves and aliens were excluded. 
- Classical meaning of power: collective expression for community.
- Modern meaning: expression by a few that marginalizes and excludes others.
- Another modern meaning: the decision making power of certain institutions that were set aside from the rest of society (the [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/State\|State]]). The study of the State was then conflated with the study of the exercise of power. 
- If 'political' meant values common to all humanity, two more conceptions of power are created:
	- The values by which a particular community governs its life.
	- A grand political theory that reflects on the general condition of the entire human kind or values by which all of humanity may govern their lives.
------------------

Functions of political theory:
- Explains at the most general level possible
- Evaluates and tells us what we should do
- Speculates about our current and future condition
- Tells us who we are.
The questions of human life cover
- Understanding
- Explanation
- Prediction
- Ethics
- Normative ideals
- Metaphysical self-knowledge
These questions are raised when:
- An individual feels alienation from the community: crisis of mutual understanding
- Entry of a stranger who causes curiosity and dissonance
- Unpredictable changes in the natural world
In order to answer these questions, communities create cosmologies, which create narratives to make sense of the chaos. ([[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]] is informed by these cosmologies).

Role of social and political theory:
1. Interpretative and explanatory role: pre-reflective conceptual understanding is grasped and made explicit.
2. Inquiry using a speculative jump: explains using theory on a general level. Provides insights into general patterns of human practices and explanations for large-scale phenomena.
3. Normative role: evaluates the dimensions of human actions and institutions, addressing questions of justice, rights and morality.

Political theory declined in modern ages due to the importance of the empirical sciences. This is due to positivism, which rejects subjectivity and requires observable facts. However, it is still necessary because:
- Values and facts are intertwined. This makes it necessary to employ the use of subjectivity, especially if studying the social world.
- Human phenomena are inherently normative, making empirical science by itself inadequate.

Need for political theory:
- General despite different context: provide frameworks for a large range of situations.
- Managing disagreement in pluralist societies.
- Answering ethical questions which cannot be answered by empirical sciences alone. 

Types of political theory:
- Interpretive and explanatory.
	- Such as [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]]'s theory of historical materialism and Weber's analysis of Protestant ethic.
- Normative.
- Contemplative.
	- Gandhi's Hind Swaraj.
	- [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Hannah Arendt\|Hannah Arendt]]'s The Human Condition.

Relationship between theory and ideology
- Both guide human action through persuasion.
- Theory is based on reason, truth and objectivity. Any claims it makes are generally backed up by evidence.
- Ideology is more concerned with prescribing action, less bothered about reasoning, prioritizing efficiency.

Relevance of political theory in modern societies:
- Ethical prescription
- General understanding.
