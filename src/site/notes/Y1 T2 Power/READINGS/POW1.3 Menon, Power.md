Written by [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Nivedita Menon\|Nivedita Menon]], explaining the different conceptions of [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/Power\|Power]], and how it is a concept that is "essentially contested".

Robert Dahl's definition:
'A has power over B to the extent that A can get B to do something which B would not otherwise do.'
Assumptions: 
1. Attribute of an individual that can be used over others.
2. Domination over others, forcing unwilling individuals to do something.

These assumptions are challenged by various scholars:
- Marxists: attributed to society at a collective level, and that it is unequally distributed in a society with social classes. Labour power produced by the lower class is stolen by the upper.
- Feminists: patriarchal structures contributing to the systematic domination of men over women. 
- [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Hannah Arendt\|Hannah Arendt]]: power is enabling, and enhances capacity to do things through collective action - "power to, not power power over". It also enables people to act morally responsibly.

Other understandings of power:
- Talcott Parsons: power circulates just like money, and it is the means to ensure performance of political obligations. Both facilitative and systemic.

- Steven Lukes and WB Galie: Power is an "essentially contested" concept.
	- Concepts are inseparable from values. 
	- By expressing the meaning of a concept, you imbue values into it and devalue other concept by choosing one description over another. 
- Dimensions of political power:
	- To ensure a set of interests prevails over others (Dahl's interpretation).
	- To ensure some issues never come up for debate in the first place. Peter Bachrach and Morton Baratz argue that by only looking at the obvious, in situations where people seem to be equal, power may already have been exercised. 
	- Structural understanding of power: Steven Lukes explains that even people's interests may be shaped by those wielding power, similar to the Marxist understanding of power.
- Called "essentially contested" because some may disagree with the second and third dimensions.
