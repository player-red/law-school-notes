- Asks the reader to imagine a society in which rights do not exist.
	- Why do political theorists need to imagine a situation in which 
- Doctrine of logical correlativity: all duties entail rights and vice versa.
	- Feinberg partially agrees and disagrees, since 'duty' means obligation, something you are supposed to do for someone else.
	- However, there are many duties which do not entail rights of other people, simply something required to be done, whether by law, higher authority or conscience.
- Personal desert
	- A reward given because of someone 'deserving' it — still does not entail a right.
	- Since no right exists, a person cannot demand it, nor is a master/teacher/etc expected to give it.
- Sovereign monopoly of rights
	- All obligations owed to God alone, including personal contractual obligations.
	- Similar to [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]' [[Y1 T2 Power/READINGS/POW5.01, 6.01 Hobbes, Leviathan\|POW5.01, 6.01 Hobbes, Leviathan]].
	- All commands given in the name of the sovereign, but intermediate superiors do possess legal powers and privileges to create obligations and impose penalties, while they do not have claim-rights against anyone.

- The citizens of this hypothetical do not claim anything, even if they are treated terribly. 
	- This is because they have no notion of rights. 
	- Link between rights and claiming: usage of the term 'claim-rights': when someone has a claim-right to X,  they are at liberty with respect to X, and this liberty forms the ground for other people's duty to grant him X or not to interfere with him with respect to X.
- Rights entail duties.
- However, claim-rights are more basic than the duties which they entail. 
- Rights are equated with claims quite often, but Feinberg argues that a right is a kind of claim, and a claim is an assertion of a right.
- Claiming is a rule-governed activity. 

Distinguishing between types of "claiming"
(i) making claim to: to demand what is due
- Can only claim what you have a right to
- Making legal claim to: entails legal performance with legal consequences
(ii) claiming that
- Assert any statement, with or without having a right 
(iii) having a claim
- to be in a position to claim, to make claim to or claim that
- shows that verbalisation of right is more important than its normative aspect

- Claims are minimal plausibility that someone has a right to something, to have a fair hearing and consideration.
- Claims differ in degree, whereas rights are equal in degree. 

Differentiation between claims and rights in international law
- Needs, he argues, must not be construed with rights: this is because rights are always held against someone as duties. Needs cannot be held against someone to provide.
- Rather, a young orphan's need of good food, an education, etc. is a claim rather than a right.
- Claims based on needs alone are 'permanent possibilities of rights'.

McCloskey's argument:
- Rights are entitlements, not claims: they are 'rights to', not 'rights against'.
- Flaws in this argument:
	- Rights are not held against others (admits that rights in personam are held against others, but rights in rem cannot be).
		- McCloskey says that rights in rem are too general, and would require the creation of a hypothetical people to hold them against. 
		- However, it simply means each human being can hold a right against millions of others, imposing millions of duties on each individual which are easily discharged. 
		- Feinberg argues that if humans make up one moral community, then it follows that there are millions of moral relations between them.
	- All claims are essentially against, not to.
		- The law recognizes claims to that are not yet qualified as claims against.
		- Two dimensions of claims and rights: "to" and "against".

- Rights merge entitlements to and claims against.
- Claim-rights must have both these dimensions.
- Activity of claiming provides for a sense of self-respect and respect for others.
