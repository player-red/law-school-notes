Meaning of secularism
- Christian roots of the term
	- Author argues that this does not limit it from being applied to societies with other dominant forms of religion. 
	- Origin from the Latin word "saeculum": century/age
	- Often used to set apart the Church and regular clergy from the more worldly people and institutions that formed the government ([[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/State\|State]]). 
	- Shows the requirement of distance of the Church from the rest of the world. 
- Need for the term in order for Christians of different sects to coexist peacefully. 
	- Public domain needed rules that could transcend doctrinal boundaries. 
- There were two approaches to this need for coexistence:
	- Common ground approach
	- Independent political ethic

Common ground approach
- A political order based on some doctrines that were common across all Christian sects/theistic religions. 
- Conception of Natural Law similar to [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/John Locke\|John Locke]]'s. 
- Could lead to an idea of Deism that believes there is a supreme creator God, but one who does not interfere with human affairs. In such a conception of the world, humans must use their rationality and observation to understand the world. 
- Weakness: excludes those of other religions, especially since the number of people following different religions has increased, it becomes impossible to accommodate everyone. 

Independent political ethic 
- Grotius explored this idea. 
- Humans are rational and sociable creatures. 
- We can theorize principles of ethics by ourselves using these qualities, not requiring the moral imperatives of religion. 
- Demands by religion must be shrunk in order to use this method. 
	- As demonstrated by [[Y1 T2 Power/PEOPLE/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]]' [[Y1 T2 Power/READINGS/POW5.01, 6.01 Hobbes, Leviathan\|POW5.01, 6.01 Hobbes, Leviathan]], the demands of Christianity become irrelevant to the public sphere. 
	- It pushes the expression of faith to the private sphere. 
	- Complete separation of the Church and State: the State does not support any religion nor pursue any religious goals.
- The goal of this ethic is not to make religion irrelevant, rather stop the State from favouring one particular religion over another. 
- Weakness: this ethic will become the basis for the moral lives of atheists, who will then mock people who do believe in some form of religion or God. The application of principles of neutrality will become an attack on religion, and the public expression of religion would become violations of these principles. 

Third approach
- Hybrid of the two approaches. 
- Can be described by 'overlapping consensus' (John Rawls).
- Removes the requirement of a commonly held foundation (requirement of the independent ethic). It recognizes that this requirement might lead to a State in which a tyrant tries to impose their ideals on others. 

II
- Nations form part of a collective imagination. 
- Features of the modern imaginary:
	- Shift from hierarchical societies to direct-access societies. This forms a direct relationship between citizen and State.
		- People believe that there is a common public sphere in which they all participate.
		- The advent of print media and instantaneous news means that a nation is easier to imagine as a whole. 
		- Abolishes heterogeneity, making every man uniform and hence equal. 
	- Translocal entities are not part of something 'higher' anymore. 

- [[Y1 T2 Power/CONCEPTS/Social Contract Theory\|Social Contract Theory]]: the movement of people from the state of nature to society. 
- Through this theory and the establishment of the American Constitution, the 'crucial fiction' of "we, the people" was created. 
	- This gave rise to the idea that a 'people' can exist without the nation, and that both can have distinct personalities. 
- Simultaneity of society formed a sense of belonging to the nation. 
- Governments gain legitimacy from the 'will of the people.'
- In order to have free society, we need self-enforcement of duty towards the State (patriotism).
	- The identity of the citizen must take precedence over all other identities. 
- The political society fails to be fully legitimate in the eyes of a minority group when:
	1. Their way of seeing things is different from the majority. 
	2. That this way is not understood or recognized by the majority. 
	3. The majority is not willing to accommodate this difference
	4. Hence, they are systematically unheard. 
- Hence, secularism is necessary in religiously diverse societies. 

In India:
- Common ground secularism was used based on the principles of common religious ideas and symbols, along with a historically continuous civilization.
- Some Indians have always believed that India is only for Hindus, and no one else. 
- The BJP believes that Indians should accept that Hindus are historically predominant. 
	- This view causes almost total exclusion of non-Hindus. 
	- The logic of democracy, if fallen to this temptation, becomes one of ethnic cleansing. 

III
Rawls' overlapping consensus
- Convergence will include common rights for both individuals and communities.
- Rights attached to citizenship, so they are enjoyed equally. 
- The justification of a political ethic is interpreted by its origin. 
- Overlapping consensus remains despite debates in the public sphere about the origins of our principles, because of some convergent ideas.
