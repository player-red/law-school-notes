- Devaluation of labour along with the increase in value of material objects. 
- Labour is now a commodity, embodied in the product and objectified. ([[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/READINGS/PRIMARY/SOC2.05 Marx & Engels, The Communist Manifesto\|SOC2.05 Marx & Engels, The Communist Manifesto]])
- Estrangement of the product: the worker loses himself to the product, and loses the product itself. 

- Nature provides physical sustenance for the worker. 
	- "means of life"
- It also provides the materials through which the products are created.
- Hence, the more the worker appropriates natural resources, the more he deprives himself of the means of life. It also no longer serves as a resource to support his work. 

Alienation of labour
- Labour is external to the worker.
- Marx says that a worker's labour is not voluntary, rather forced, since when he is working he does not feel at home. 
- Means to satisfy needs.
- As long as no compulsion exists, labour is shunned. 
- Does not belong to the labourer, rather to someone else. 
- "What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal."
	- He says this because all activities (eating, drinking, etc.) the worker feels most active, which are animal functions.
	- In human functions, the worker feels like an animal. 

Universality of man
- Nature is part of man's inorganic body.
	- We live on nature, and without it we would die. 
	  Hence, our spiritual and physical life is linked to nature. 
- In separating man from nature and himself, it changes the life of the species into an individual life. 
- An animal is one with its life activity. 
	- Man is conscious about his life activity, separating him from animals. 
- Estranged labour turns man's species being into a separate entity, unknown to him, and a means for individual existence. 
	- This separate entity or alien can only be man himself. 
	- Labour than belongs to a man other than the worker.
- This leads to estrangement of man from man.

Private property
- Product of alienated labour, a consequence of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself. 
- Real soul of production is the political economy, which begins from labour. 
- Wages = private property
	- The product and object of the labour pays for itself.
- Emancipation of society from private property would lead to emancipation of workers.
- "The non-worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself; but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker."
