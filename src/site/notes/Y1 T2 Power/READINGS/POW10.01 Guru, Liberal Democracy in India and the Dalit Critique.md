- Liberal democracy is attractive to different social groups for different reasons.
	- Elite: could extend their power and influence that was taken away during the colonial period. 
	- Historically disadvantaged: chance to gain rights, liberty and dignity. 
- Democracy and nationalism came at the same time, hence their reasonings were conflated. 
- Nationalist imagination created two different notions of self-esteem: 
	- Elites: humiliation due to denial of self-rule.
	- Dalits: humiliation due to the social and economic setup ([[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Caste\|Caste]] — Brahmanism and [[Y1 T2 Economy/CONCEPTS/Capitalism\|Capitalism]]).
- Hence, the Dalit response put Swabhiman over Abhiman (self-respect over the pride of the nation).
	- Importance of social needs over political needs.
	- Feared upper-caste Indians would use the independence struggle to gain power for themselves and continue oppressing lower castes. 
- Many scholars placed more importance on the well-being of institutions rather than the well-being of humans. 

Notions of self-esteem
- Robert Nozick: based on social comparison. 
- Avishai Margalit: individual achievement and social ranking. 
	- Distinguishes between self-esteem and self-respect. 
	- Self-respect: treatment of the individual by others, self-esteem: treatment of the individual by themselves, supported by government efforts.

How liberal democracy has affected the opportunities for Dalits to enhance self-esteem and gain self-respect:
- Aspects of liberal democracy such as adult franchise and political rights enable an individual to express self-esteem. 
- Realization of self-esteem requires:
	- Social comparison/ranking
	- Differentiation of roles and mixed social composition (caste, race, [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]]) + equal talent and caliber.
	- Expression of individual achievement.
- The number of Dalit members in Parliament are a testament to the achievements they have made which enhanced their self-esteem. 
	- Their role as untouchables became a role to head government institutions. 
	- Self-respect is gained when they vicariously express political power by making references to other Dalits in power. 
- In order to deny Dalits a sense of self-esteem and self-respect, upper-caste individuals use humiliating language and violent reactions. 
- Callous attitude towards the conditions faced by Dalits creates a social perception that Dalits themselves are the filth they are forced to live in. 
- Subtle forms of denial:
	- Non-Dalit legislators and bureaucrats reduce social welfare departments to ghettos, since there is a deep-rooted repulsion to the mere presence of Dalits in government. 
	- Ritual purification of offices once occupied by Dalit officials is common even among judges. 
	- Insulation from institutions that have Dalit content and orientation by either staying away or creating new ones. 
	- Exclusion of Dalits in general, denying values of egalitarianism which is a cornerstone of liberal democracies. 
		- Leads to uniform social composition of institutions which become symbols of identity rather than ideas. 

Another definition of self-respect
- Positive attitude adopted towards the self. 
- Denying one's moral worth = loss of self-respect. 
- Struggling for relative worth instead of equal worth leads to loss of self-respect. 
- Language, gestures, and participation of Dalit officials remain servile. 
	- Dalit representatives rarely speak in Parliament unless it is about Dalits.
- Self-esteem is only gained when some self-respect is lost. 
- Non-Dalits often reduce Dalit claims for self-esteem, questioning why they do not aim for the same goals as non-Dalits. 
- Dalits feel compelled to be subservient to patrons who provide political support, putting them into a state of "paternal liberalism". They are limited by it and expected to stay within its bounds. 
- Institutions such as the social justice ministry contain, rather than support, Dalit aspirations. 
- [[ARCHIVE/Y1/Y1 T1/Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/André Béteille\|André Béteille]] argues that the quota system is responsible for infusing political institutions with caste. 
	- Scholars who argue along these lines would say that this interferes with the impersonal aspect of political power. 
	- This argument suggests that there was a previous state in which public institutions were not imbued with casteism, and that reservations introduce it. 
	- The Dalit lived experience challenges this argument, since public officials are often interested in the caste of the Dalit rather than their capability. 
- Upper-castes choose to enforce their social authority and constantly test Dalits. 
	- Dalits face the compulsion to remain rational and act unemotional. 
	- It also enforces the view that only upper-castes are rational. 
	- Leads to alienation from themselves and from their constituency. 
	- End up in institutions with uniform social composition due to the tendency to choose an institution without this constant strain. 
		- Self-esteem lies in difference.
	- Some institutions become extremely divided on caste, region and language lines after the most secular process. 
- Ethics and the law have an inverse relationship: lack of ethics --> legal intervention necessary, abundance of ethics --> legal intervention not as necessary.
- In India, the law often governs ethics, which means legal interventions are necessary. 
- Law then becomes the preferred form of ethics for upper-castes.
	- Treating Dalits as morally equal would lead to social loss. 
	- The violation of law by upper-castes does not involve risk. 
- Hence, Ambedkar advocates the usage of the ethical instead of the legal domain to pursue dignity and liberation. 

- Segmentation of Dalits:
	- Toiling masses
		- In order to prevent unrest among the masses, the 100-day employment guarantee and other similar schemes are employed.
	- Educated, unemployed
		- Find promise in the ideas of liberal democracy.
		- Fall into the trap that is identity politics, since it requires lobbying and personal favours. 
		- Community resources used for personal advancement --> ignoring the use of mass movements. 
		- The desire to become socially mobile/bourgeois leads to internal aggression and external appeal, and the adoption of paternal liberalism.
	- Invisible portion of the Dalit community: ragpickers, construction workers, scavengers, etc. 
		- Outside of the framework of the liberal democracy, since they are unable to claim control over the state. 
		- There is an overt absence of the language of rights, preventing their assertion of dignity and liberty.
- Ambedkar says liberal democracy failed for various reasons:
	- Its institutions cannot exorcise the ghost of caste. 
	- Enforced caste affinity while losing impartiality and procedural justice. 
	- Individualism destroys the resources required for Dalit emancipation. 

Conclusion: Indian liberalism helped Dalits achieve self-esteem, but not self-respect, especially in the eyes of the upper castes.
