English political philosopher, active during the 17th century. Wrote about an absolutist theory of state and nature of man in his book, Leviathan ([[Y1 T2 Power/READINGS/POW2.5-6 Hobbes, Leviathan\|POW2.5-6 Hobbes, Leviathan]]). Many of his views were likely influenced by the civil war between the Monarch and Parliament, leading him to believe that without a common power to rule over all, a "war of all against all" would take place.
