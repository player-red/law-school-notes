Social Research 59(1): 17-57

- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Religion\|Religion]] is susceptible to be classified into binaries.
- One of these is the public-private binary. 
- A common statement made - "religion is a private affair"
	- Freedom of religion the first freedom under the American Constitution, and the basis of modern freedoms.
	- Creation of a private sphere in which neither the State nor the Church can interfere in. (Notion of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Secularism\|Secularism]])
	- Modernization led to control of the Church being removed from political, economic and now religious spheres (secularism).
	- Still, religions and religious practices thrive.
- "Wall" separating Church and State has several cracks:
	- Religious institutions manage to obtain public roles, and the State can get mixed up with religious movements.
	- Four developments which put religion in a prominent position:
		- Islamic revolution (Iran)
		- Solidarity (Poland)
		- Protestant fundamentalism (USA)
		- Catholicism in the Nicaraguan revolution and other Latin American movements
	- ==Paradox== of simultaneous privatization and de-privatization of religion.

Private/Public Distinction
- Jeff Weintraub's study of 'private' and 'public':
	- Liberal-economistic model: state administration (public) vs market economy (private)
	- Republic-virtue/classical: public - political community + citizenship, separate from market and administration
	- Social history/anthropological view: public as fluid and amorphous social sphere
	- Feminist ([[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]]) view: market economy (public) and family/home (private)
- Hegel: three divisions - family, civil society and state.
- Binary division mainly due to the division of ancient cities into *oikos* and *polis*.
	- In modern times, elements of both oikos and polis have fused together to form the society we experience.
- Goffman's conception of private and public: domestic and personal relations are private, everything else inclduing the market and state is public.
- Republican critiques often reduce the political to the governmental sphere and public interest to an aggregation of private interests.
- Feminist critiques: (1) male, public, political, immoral and (2) female, private, apolitical, moral realms.

==Established vs Disestablished religions (liberal-economistical model)==
- Established State churches: public
	- Fear of politicization of religion is due to the belief that it would lead to restrictions on the individual expression of religion. 
	- Fears republican civil religion, which is a community affair (public profession of faith aiming to inculcate political values in a country, according to Britannica). 
- Disestablished churches: private
	- Understood as the depoliticization and privatization of religion since this approach confuses state, public and political. 
	- Believe that religion should remain private.
- This follows the traditional view of separation of church and State.
- Casanova argues that this view is correct in arguing that disestablishment + free religious market = apolitical and pluralist denominationalism.

==Civil Religions vs Alternative Religious Communities (republican/virtue/classical view)==
- Public civil religions: cult of political community with shared values
- Private domestic cults: individualistic cults of salvation.
- Causes tension between the compulsory public cult and the smaller, primordial, communal expressions of religion.  
- If the religion carries a message of salvation, it creates two problems:
	- Frees the individual from absolute allegiance to the public cult and instead explore individual expression.
	- Lets an individual join others in a religion that transcends the boundaries of the State. 
- Needs to figure out how to politicize religion and use it to integrate without creating a theocracy. 
	- If successful, will cause the impairment of religion due to secular control over the expression of religion. 
		- Erastianism: the idea that the State should have supremacy over the Church in ecclesiastical matters.
- Prefers to banish religion to the private sphere and pursue secular politics.

==Individual Mysticism vs Denominationalism (social history/anthropological view)==
- Social historian P. Ariès and sociologist E. Goffman's views on distinguishing the public and private spheres. 
- P. Ariès: private and domestic vs. public sphere of polymorphous sociability.
- E. Goffman: presocial individual vs public sphere as social interactions.
- Individual sphere seen as the expression of spiritual religion, having nothing to do with the public sphere. 
- Public sphere is seen as the denomination (relatively modern form of religion) - a voluntary and pluralistic form of religious expression. 
	- Does not fit into Troeltsch's tripartite construction of Christianity, which included the Church, the sect and individual mysticism. 
	- Denominationalism is an adaptation of religious organizations to modern society. 
- Example of polytheism: ancient polytheism: temple was the Pantheon, where all gods could be worshiped simultaneously, modern polytheism: this temple is the human mind.
	- Fusion of individual mysticism and Renaissance rationalism.
	- Turned into the cult of the individual, foreseen by [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Émile Durkheim\|Émile Durkheim]].
- Due to the denominational structure of American religions and freedom to hold any beliefs, all religions that enter America become organized as denominations.
- Recently, internal denominational ties have been weakening, and interdenominational prejudices have as well - leading to sharing of resources across denominations rather than through them. 
	- Casanova argues that this is an example of the logic of denominationalism.
	- Denominationalism has never meant exclusivity to one, simply collections of personal religious experiences.
- Individuals part of organized religion now reserve the right to decide which doctrines they consider essential, and how to interpret them. 

==Home vs Religious Market (feminist view)==
- Only salaried employment outside the home is recognized as work, ignoring the labour required in households, mostly performed by women. 
- Leisure becomes commodified and turned into the sphere of 'culture'.
- To say that religion is a private affair assigns a normative expectation to the expression of religion, confining it to the 'home', not the 'household' (==privatization==) — the sphere of emotion, love, intimacy, irrationality, morality, spirituality, etc. leading to the ==feminization== of religion. 
- It became exempt from public discourse and life, to the point where expressing a religious belief in public was seen as bad taste.
- Luckmann argues that churches are no longer relevant to religion, as the quest for salvation has become an individual one. 
	- Explained by institutional and role differentiation, which means all the spheres of life became distinct categories, with their own autonomy — no overlaps with others.
	- Similarly, religion becomes a part-time activity within the individual sphere. 
- Public institutions do not need to maintain a religious attitude, since the quest for meaning is now a personal affair. 
- The 'cult of the individual' supports secularization and dehumanization of the social structure.
	- This is because the idea of assigning a certain holiness to the subjectivity of the human experience, we alienate and isolate ourselves from each other. 

Religious Revivals
- Recently, a movement of deprivatization of religion has begun, a reassertion of 'public' religion. 
- 70s and 80s saw an outburst of religion globally. 
- In the 1980s, what was new was the vitality that these religious movements carried with them, enough to create political revolts. 
- We do not know what these religious developments will mean for differentiation - religious institutions will continue to refuse to restrict themselves to the private sphere and influence public life.
- To question privatization of religion simply means to wonder whether religious institutions will still play a role in public life, not to advocate the return of normative public religion. 

Religious Differentiation

(1) Individual and group religiosity
- These two reject the other.
- Two varying perspectives: one which champions the individual, and the other which champions community. 
- Individual perspective:
	- The individual aspect (personal religion - feelings and experiences differing from person to person) is primordial, and the institutional aspect (community, worship, ritual, theology, etc) are secondary.
		- William James
	- Individual charisma vs the routinization of charisma (religious roles and institutions that are created when community is involved).
		- Weber
-  Community perspective:
	- Religion always involves community, such as a church. Any individual expression is derived from a group religion or is not religion, but magic.
		- Durkheim and W. Robertson Smith.
