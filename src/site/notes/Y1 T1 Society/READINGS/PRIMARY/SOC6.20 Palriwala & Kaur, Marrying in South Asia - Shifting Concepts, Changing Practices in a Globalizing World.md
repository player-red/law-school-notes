'Introduction: Marriage in South Asia: Continuities and Transformations' (pg 1-27)
tags: #kinship , #family , #marriage 

- [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Pierre Bourdieu\|Pierre Bourdieu]] criticized the formal and legal models of studying kinship, stating if that the rules were decided, the only thing left was deviance.
- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Family\|Family]] and marriage are closely intertwined, because marriage is the joining of two communities.
- There has been a call for the unified analysis of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]] and [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Kinship\|Kinship]].

- Marriage is defined as an alliance in structuralist and political terms. 
- It is also a social institution: it gives recognition in social and legal forms to the alliance of the partners, and by extension their families.
- It legitimizes any children and makes them eligible for inheritance and status. It also connects them to the rest of the community that the couple belongs to. 
	- This is the main reason why people get married: it provides safety and stability through involving the public and the State.
	- It provides a variety of rights and duties that would not be present otherwise.
		- This marginalizes those in relationships that fall outside the ambit of marriage: unmarried, divorced, homosexual, widowed, etc.

Differences between North and South Indian marriage practices

| North Indian                        | South Indian                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proscribed consanguineous marriages | Preference for consanguineous marriages                                          |
| Usually patrilocal                  | (Malabar, Northeast, Sri Lanka) matrilineal, did not always follow patrilocality |
- Both had differing views on dowry and bride price.

Why many diversities have not been mapped:
- Dominance of upper-caste Hindus: used as the blueprint for the [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]] understanding of marriage
	- Differences between otherwise very similar groups get erased.
- How marriage changes the lives of women: not documented until very recently.

Gender studies gaining importance:
- North-south differences earned some attention since the complications women faced after marriage started receiving attention.
- Geo-cultural divides being examined

- Consanguineous marriages do not happen simply because of religion, but also:
	- Greater compatibility
	- Secular prestige
	- constrains dowry (both pro and con: some avoid it because of this)
	- maintaining community identity, especially among shrinking communities.

Class differences in marriage:
- Previous studies focused mainly on elite groups, overlooking any differences experienced by non-elite groups.
- Common trend of rising age of marriage.
- Gap between the time at which marriage takes place and when cohabitation begins. 

Money, dowry and inheritance:
- Educated women are often sent off with large dowries, especially because they do not want to jeopardize their relationship with their brothers by claiming part of the inheritance.
	- This is because brothers can often be a strong source of support when a woman is married. 
- A working class woman often can negotiate better terms, since she earned her own dowry. 
- Marriage celebrations are progressively becoming more expensive, especially among upper and middle classes.
	- Aids the performance of marriage rituals. 
	- 'Ideal' wedding is 'traditional': however is simply an expression of status (how much money they can afford to throw away on a wedding).
	- This is the commonsense understanding of what a wedding should look like. 

- Due to the paradigm of a upper-class, upper-caste Hindu wedding, any deviation from the "normal" decided by society results in violence, especially against the bride. 
	- Honour killings: often occur when the bride chooses her own groom - defying social control and endo-/exogamy.
