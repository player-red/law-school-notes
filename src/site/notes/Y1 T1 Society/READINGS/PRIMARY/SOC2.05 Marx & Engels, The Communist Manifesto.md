==Quotes:==

- "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."
- "But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons - the modern working class - the proletarians."
- "But every class struggle is a political struggle."

Pointers:
The Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat:
- The bourgeoisie is the class of people who own the means of social production (land) and employ wage laborers.
- The proletariat are the class oppressed by the bourgeoisie, made to compete with each other and sell their labour for minimal wages.
- Commodification: when people are made to purchase concepts as products (labor, the commodification of girlhood, etc)

Modes of production
- The way society is organized during a specific time period:
	1. Subsistence
	2. Feudalism
	3. Capitalism
	4. Communism
	- This is arranged in chronological order, with communism being the outcome hoped for by Marx.
- Capitalism is the mode of production the world currently follows - it rose after the collapse of feudalism. 
	- It led to the simplification of class relations and the rise of two main camps, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 
	- After the collapse of feudalism, the colonization of various countries led to the opening up of markets and the beginning of the manufacturing industry.
	- With innovations in machinery, the need for special skills among laborers fell greatly, so this meant the ruling class could pay lower wages, earn surplus capital and reinvest into the business.
	- Due to their constantly growing economic influence and control over jobs, they gained political power.
- Tearing apart of feudal ties: all relations are reduced to economic relations.
	- Previously, exploitation was veiled by religious and political illusions, now it is direct.
	- Reduced family relations to mere monetary relations.
- Made personal wealth into something that can be bought and sold through Free Trade and the free markets.
- Previously, the ruling class was dependent on keeping the modes of production the same. Now, the bourgeoisie thrives on constantly revolutionizing the modes of production and creating uncertainty, especially among laborers.
- Colonialism and globalization gave companies access to raw materials from all over the world, even the most remote areas. Similarly, consumption of foreign goods is the highest it has ever been, due to the perpetual need for bigger/newer markets by the bourgeoisie. 
- Due to this newfound interdependence of nations, the bourgeoisie forces everyone to join the system by enticing them with cheap prices and efficiency. 
- Due to the concentration of power in a few hands, centralization of political power was the result - the formation of the State and one government to rule all. 
- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Social Reproduction\|Social Reproduction]]: the concept of passing down of inequalities in a society through the ==mode of production. ==
	- The bourgeoisie owns private property = they control it.
	- The proletariat sells its labour power and earns wages in exchange.
		- COMMODIFICATION OF LABOUR.
	- In many cases, the bourgeoisie does not pay proportionate to the labour the proletariat provides: this is called exploitation or stealing of labour/the labour theory of value. 
	- Production of goods = raw material + time + energy + skill (the last three are provided by the laborer.)
- Means of production: instruments or forces of production. 
- The reproductive labour of women ([[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]], [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]], [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Domestic labour\|Domestic labour]]) is essential for furthering capitalism: without the birth and nurturing of new members of the proletariat, the capitalist system cannot survive.
- There is constant competition among the proletariat, who compete to earn wages, while the bourgeoisie compete among themselves for higher profits.
- Since the rise of machines for the production of goods, the workers have become appendages to the machines, only required to operate them - this leads to longer work hours or the demanding of higher efficiency.
- The labour of men and women is barely differentiated between, since the skill and exertion of strength required has reduced greatly.

The struggle of the proletariat
- Attacks against the individual bourgeois and the instruments of production - as an incoherent, scattered mass.
- If they form a union (formed by the bourgeoisie), they fight the enemies of the bourgeoisie instead: the remnants of the monarchy, landowners, petty bourgeois, etc. in that sense, the bourgeoisie are the victors. (==Class in itself: unaware of their shared interests==)
- Once they realize they greatly overpower the bourgeoisie in number and form their own active unions and associations, and they are victors when their union keeps expanding. (==Class for itself/class-consciousness: aware of shared interests, leads to collective action==)
- These personal troubles can be turned into class awareness by the use of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/The Sociological Imagination\|The Sociological Imagination]].

The bourgeoisie's need for the proletariat
- In order to fight its adversaries (the aristocracy, foreign bourgeoisie, etc), it brings the proletariat into the political arena and provides political and general education. 
- Essential conditions for existence: formation and augmentation of capital, and the condition for capital is wage labour.
	- Wage labour depends on competition between laborers.
	- Competition and association of laborers is promoted by the advance of industry, promoted by the bourgeoisie.
	- Hence, the bourgeoisie is digging its own grave.
