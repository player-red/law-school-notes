Chapter 1: 'Squinting at Society' (pg 1-24)
tags: #basics 

- Written by [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Satish Deshpande\|Satish Deshpande]], prominent Indian economist and sociologist.
- Explains his theory of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]] and sociology.

- Commonsense is acquired through years of social training, though it is perceived to be untaught/something that cannot be taught.
- Everyone is expected to know and follow these shared values, attitudes and habits.
- It varies from society to society.
- Pre-judice: it is part of our unconscious, and affects our conscious judgments before we make them.
	- Our perceptions and beliefs are all affected by it.
- Represents our unexamined & unconscious beliefs and opinions.

Edmund Husserl's perspective
- The social world has infinite meanings that cannot be categorized like rational sciences.
	- Labels: symbolic interactionism, ethnomethodology, phenomenological sociology, etc: explain that humans attach meanings to certain symbols and gestures and navigate the social world through using and interpreting these symbols.
- These background understandings can never be fully explained, because they also depend on what is unsaid/implied, not just what is said.
- This perspective sees commonsense as a toolkit to decode and code social interactions.

Antonio Gramsci's perspective
- Commonsense is the philosophy inherited from the socio-cultural environment. 
- The power structure that prevails in that society exerts influence on the commonsense notions that the people hold. (hegemony)
	- This helps legitimize the power structure.
	- It also makes it more vulnerable to reformulation through propaganda or other subversive means.

[[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Pierre Bourdieu\|Pierre Bourdieu]]'s perspective
- the 'doxa' is what goes without saying, and universally accepted.
- it refuses to accept other opinions.
- He explains how it causes an illusion of choice: he explains how people with free will choose options within institutional restraints.

- How to think about and critique commonsense: convert pre-judice to post-judice.
	- Examine commonsense with rationality, look at which values we cherish and despise, and then look at society.
	- [[ARCHIVE/Y1 T1 Narrative/READINGS/NAR2.4 Plato, Apology\|NAR2.4 Plato, Apology]] - "for a human being a life without examination is actually not worth living"
- Sociologists need to learn how to see both commonsense and society at the same time, and figure out how each affects the other.

Aspects affecting Indian sociology:
1. Ambivalent image of the science itself, from colonial times.
2. Extreme similarity between sociology and social anthropology in India.
3. Constant anxiety of the Indian-ness of sociology.
