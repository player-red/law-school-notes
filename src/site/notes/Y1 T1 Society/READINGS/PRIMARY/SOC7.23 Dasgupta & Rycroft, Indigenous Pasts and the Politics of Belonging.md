- Adivasi subjectivity: cannot be defined through the word tribe, has to include historical context including de-colonization.
	- Most Adivasi communities had vastly different experiences with colonialism, hence there are multiple Adivasi subjectivities. 
- 'Adivasi' (Hindi) means original inhabitants of a place.
	- Used to refer to different people in different places.
	- First used in Jharkhand when the Adivasi Mahasabha was created in 1938.
	- Now translated as Indigenous and Tribal Peoples to be part of the transnational Indigenous movement.
- Racial and cultural distinctiveness gained recognition due to anti-colonial movements.
- Subaltern societies gained recognition and some customary laws in the post-Emergency period. 
- Helping Adivasi communities express their community consciousness and build a political foundation.

- Risley's definition of a tribe: collection of families sharing the same name (no specific occupation), claiming descent from a mythical ancestor or animal.
	- Distinguished from [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Caste\|caste]] and religion, instead made the term 'tribe' a definable object.

- To codify land rights, colonial policy and ethnography developed and finally separated. 
	- It was during this time that caste and tribe were separated.
	- Category of tribe kept being modified to suit the situation. 
	- Always othered from the rest of the population (hill- and forest-dwellers vs plain-dwellers, aboriginals vs Hindus, animists vs polytheists, etc.) - [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Othering\|Othering]].
	- Notion of tribes as primitive also internalized by modernist Indian thinkers, attempts to diverge from highlighting racial typography resulted in perpetuating primitivist tendencies.
	- Sarat Chandra Roy simply presented 'tribal' cultures as fully separate from Hindu civilization.
