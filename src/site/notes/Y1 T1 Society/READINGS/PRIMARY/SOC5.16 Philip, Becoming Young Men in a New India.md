Introduction: Young Men in Neoliberal India (pg 1-29)
tags: #feminism, #gender, #patriarchy , #caste, #class 

Pointers:

- Used [[Y1 T1 Numbers/CONCEPTS/Ethnography\|Ethnography]] as the main research method.
- Patriarchy is a result of caste and class relations, and both are intertwined.
	- Working class women are allowed to move through 'public spaces', but upper-class/caste women are gated and kept 'pure'.

Impact of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Neoliberalism\|Neoliberalism]] on the lives and masculinity of young men, the way they interact with others and travel around the city. 
	- Exact opposite of 'old' traditions: instead of maintaining social and sexual distance from women before an arranged marriage, young men now have girlfriends/sexual partners.
	- Indian State moved away from the developmental and socialist agenda to a consumerist and capitalist agenda.
	- 'New' India was created, with increasing inequalities creating a large middle class with spending power.
	- Hence, consumption is affected by class, as well as gender.
	- 'Modernizing' is not done through copying the West, rather through 'Indianising' modernity - consumption, however, makes having Western tastes aspirational. 
	- Having visual indicators of wealth (branded items, luxury goods) is seen as a sign of national development - consumerism itself has become 'development.'
	- People who enjoy leisure tend to distance themselves from the image that India is a third-world country. 
	- The poor are considered as lazy and as having only themselves to blame for being poor. (Exactly what [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Pierre Bourdieu\|Pierre Bourdieu]] cautioned against)

- Many middle class people believe the slums and the people living in them are nothing but trash/wastes of space, and try to escape from those sides of the city. 
- Politicians frame modernity as the cause for rapes and high rates of violence against women, conveniently ignoring that the rates of violence were similar even in 'old/traditional' India.

Strivers and Seekers
- Due to neoliberalism, women enter the workforce and gain spending power - they are not as reliant on men as they used to be. 
- This causes a feeling of 'uselessness' among men, creating 'Strivers' who are trying to create a new India in which they are useful.
- The richer ones ('upper-middle class') are called 'Strivers' and the lower-middle class ones are called 'Seekers'. 

Grooming, Roaming and Protecting
- Roaming: wandering aimlessly, going to clubs, drinking, smoking, etc. in places that are quite affluent/developed. 
	- Young men are extremely mobile and access to every form of transportation, but are annoyed by the presence of women-only coaches + the presence of women in the general coach. 
- Protecting: they see themselves as the saviors of their female relatives, from the 'uncivilized' low-class, migrant (often), poor men. 
	- They think the city is naturally unsafe and try to limit the movement of their female relatives due to their sense of responsibility. (paternalism)
	- Hypocrisy: they make lewd comments and gestures towards women they saw while roaming, even trying to touch them. 
- Grooming: young men are surrounded by images of what their bodies should look like, eg muscular, hairless, fair, active, and heterosexual. 
	- They believe women enjoy seeing them in this way. 

History of Indian Masculinity
Pre-colonial times:
- Military service was highly valued because it provided employment during the agricultural off-season.
- It emphasized mental and physical ability.
- Different styles of military were established in three different regions.
Post-colonial times:
- Aggression and militarism among the British colonial forces made the general perception that the Indians were weaker and effeminate, irrational, etc.
- Hindu nationalist movements: Arya Samaj promoted the improvement of the self through exercise, both physical and mental. Also promoted controlling sexuality and the reading of the Vedas.
- Gandhi: championed moral superiority instead of physical strength through non-violent strategies. 
	- At the same time, women were reduced to their bodies and their sexuality was controlled. 
- Similarly, the loss of Hindu semen is seen as a national weakness, as compared to the narrative that Muslims are hyper-sexual and procreating rapidly. 
- Old portrayal of men in cinema: saviour, anti-hero fighting establishment --> new portrayal: always consuming luxury goods, traveling abroad, rich kid essentially. 

- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Masculinity\|Masculinity]] is always a work in progress for these men, and there is no single understanding of it. 
- Similar to [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Judith Butler\|Judith Butler]]'s theory of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Performativity\|Performativity]], and explains that it is the expression of masculinity through stylization of the body to conform to gender norms within the [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Heterosexual Matrix\|Heterosexual Matrix]]. 
	- Not just their gender, age also plays an important role - older men and women are implicitly more powerful than young men. 
	- Intertwining of caste/class: upper-class/caste women are not allowed to access public spaces, unlike working women who have always been able to. 
- Neoliberalism also led to the entry of women into the workplace, which has led to a new 'ideal' woman: a woman who can earn/provide for the family as well as keep her femininity and traditions alive through being the 'CEO of the home'.
- Young men claim that religion and caste were unimportant, which has certain implications ([[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Paradox of Castelessness\|Paradox of Castelessness]] of the upper castes is inherently a privilege - [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Satish Deshpande\|Satish Deshpande]]).
