Explanation of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Caste\|Caste]] by [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Dr B. R. Ambedkar\|Dr B. R. Ambedkar]].

- Population of India is a mixture of Aryans, Dravidians, Mongolians and Scythians. 
- Despite diverse origins of people, they united and formed a homogenous culture. 
- The caste system divides the culturally united into mutually exclusive units.

Definitions of caste:
1. Senart's definition: close corporation that is hereditary and has traditional and independent organization, including a chief and a council, joining together at festivals and bound together by common occupations. They have rules relating to food and marriage, and penalties if these rules are broken.
	- Idea of "pollution" critiqued, saying that it is not only confined to caste, more related to religion. 
2. Nesfield's definition: a community which disowns any connection with any other class and can neither intermarry nor eat nor drink with any but persons of their own community.
	- Eating with others not an explicit rule system in caste, but a natural consequence of the caste system. 
3. Risley's definition
	- Includes too much and makes no new point. 
4. Dr Ketkar's definition: a social group having two characteristics: (i) membership is confined to those who are born of members and includes all persons so born; (ii) the members are forbidden by an inexorable social law to marry outside the camp.
	- Agrees with this definition, but says that prohibition of intermarriage and membership are two sides of the same coin in caste.

- Argues that endogamy is the only feature exclusive to caste, and the social groups formed by it being followed have no natural reason to be exclusive. 
- Indian society originally followed the custom of exogamy, only developing caste when some groups imposed endogamy on themselves.
- Caste was created when endogamy was superimposed on exogamy.
- The imposition of endogamy causes problems in terms of the distribution of sexes, ie there is rarely an even number of men and women. 

To solve the issue of sex disparity and maintain endogamy, four strategies were used: 
For surplus women:
1. Sati (widow burning)
2. Enforced widowhood 
	- Risky, as the woman may rebel against such conditions.

For surplus men:
- Seen as a more pressing problem, since men occupy dominant/superior positions in the family, with the right to inherit property and carry on the family name. ([[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]], [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]])
1. Imposing celibacy on surplus men
2. Marrying pre-pubescent girls to men
	- To maintain the "purity" of the girl, so that she does not love or know any other man, pre-pubescent girls were promised in marriage to significantly older men.
