Chapter 2 (pg 17-42)

- Only a minute portion of India's labour force is part of the 'organized' economy, the rest is 'unorganized/informal', sometimes deliberately.
- There is no clear boundary between the 'organized' and 'unorganized' economy. 
- Unorganized labour is an integral part of many corporations, working on casual contracts.
	- Employers do everything in their power to evade labour laws by making sure labour is informalised.
	- Informal labour is not protected by law, hence lacking rights and stability. 
- Indian capitalism was stratified and separated into sectors, out of which the smallest minority contributes to 20% of the GDP, and their standard of living depends on the wage labour of the lower strata.
	- Agriculture: largest sector, low labour productivity.
- Biggest part of unorganized workforce: self-employed.
	- Seen as more knowledgeable and more likely to get hired.

Key factors of unorganized sector:
- Large size
- High growth
- Labour-absorptive capacity

Ways of controlling labour:
- Manipulation of social identities (caste, religion, gender etc.) 
- Fragmentation of labour markets on the basis of these social identities:
	- Contracts were affected by gender, caste, age and household composition. 
- These multiple identities make developing [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Class consciousness\|Class consciousness]] consciousness difficult, due to the conflict between classes taking precedence.

Labour-land relations:
- The landowners determine the demand for labour, and their authority is strengthened by caste and political power.
- Mechanization of agriculture led to a drop in the number of labourers that could be hired, and a fall in wages. 
	- Labour was denied access to common resources and threatened by the hiring of migrant workers in order to force them to work at low wages. 
- Flexible labour is the most desirable by employers, since costs are the lowest - easiest to achieve through casualisation. 
- Labour is bonded through debt and familial obligations, though permanent bonds are banned, they are effectively permanent. 
- Refusal to work by men has caused the permanent bondage of prepubescent girls and women ([[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]], [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]]), while men are educated in order to escape agriculture.

Spatial unit for labour:
- Seasonal migration in order to find work and get free from debt.
- Women still do not seek better opportunities in other villages, due to their duties at home and restrictions on mobility.
	- Leads to a gender difference in wages, since men are able to go look for better opportunities.
- Employers able to exploit labour whereas labourers are unable to maximize wages.
- Labourers do have political consciousness, but structure and violence on the part of employers and the State restrains them.

Gendering of work:
- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Domestic labour\|Domestic labour]] provided by women creates new labour and provides for it once it cannot work.
	- Varies with class position - women from poorer backgrounds are forced to work both inside and outside the home.
	- Educated women are prevented from working despite receiving higher education, and own disproportionally fewer assets than their male counterparts.
- Women's wages are almost universally lower than men's, and the added burden of domestic labour means they have no money returns from their work. 
- They often do not have power over domestic resources, and prioritize the household over themselves.

Age and work capacity
- Children are forced to join the labour force when adults are under/unemployed or weighed down by debt. 
- No age of retirement, those who are more fit earn more wages.

[[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Caste\|Caste]] and class:
- Compartmentalizes labour markets by creating caste divisions - this creates differences in pay across castes.
	- Lower castes: women are more likely to work, since they are poor.
- Reservations 
	- Intention: to dissolve caste differences
	- Effects: reinforced segmentation of labour.
- Attempts to unionize are resisted due to caste solidarity, especially when workers and employers belong to the same caste.
- Caste-based sociopolitical movements to improve workers' rights especially for lower castes have begun.

Workforce insecurity:
- Seasonal unemployment
- Withholding of payments
- Contracts and debt manipulated to make labour cheap at peak demand
- Being part of the permanent labour force is an aspiration, based on origin, gender and caste.

State and labour
- Public employees enjoy great benefits and security (12%.)
- Labour is 'subsidized for capital', rather than promoted through welfare schemes.
- Social security pensions: most of those who are eligible are not covered by these schemes.
- The public works created by these schemes myst be relevant to those who need them, otherwise they are useless. 

Labour politics
- Everyday resistance: non-cooperation, leaving, non-payment of debt
- Other forms: strikes, protests, wage bargaining
- Most forms of political expression are outside of work, on the basis of caste/class 
- Unions are for formalized labour (4%, fragmented across the nation), making it difficult for unorganized labour to obtain support or representation.

Conclusion:
- Labour force is easy to control and hard to organize.
- Struggles for and between class intensified by liberalization.
- Assumption of liberalization: a cheap labour force is India's advantage
	- This is wrong, because the resulting force is uneducated, malnourished and semi-literate, which is not enough for the current information economy, becoming more and more global.
