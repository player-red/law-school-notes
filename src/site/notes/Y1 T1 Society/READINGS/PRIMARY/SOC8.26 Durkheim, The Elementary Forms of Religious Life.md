Chapter 1: 'Definition of Religious Phenomena and of Religion' (pg. 21-44)
Written by [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Émile Durkheim\|Émile Durkheim]].

- Must define [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Religion\|Religion]] to avoid misrepresenting it.
- Religion can only be defined in terms of its features, and we must leave our [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]] notions behind to understand what these features are without prejudice.

"A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them. The second element thus holds a place in my definition that is no less essential than the first: In showing that the idea of religion is inseparable from the idea of a Church, it conveys the notion that religion must be an eminently collective thing."
