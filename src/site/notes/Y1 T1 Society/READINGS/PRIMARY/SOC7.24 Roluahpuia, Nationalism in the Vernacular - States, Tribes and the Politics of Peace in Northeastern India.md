The 'Tribal Question' in India: Problem of Inclusion (pp. 30-47)

- 1947-1949: integration of North-eastern states into the Union of India. 
- Regions belonging to tribal communities added as 'partially excluded' and 'excluded' areas.
	- Manipur and Tripura were part of these areas, later made districts of Assam. 
- ST is a term embraced by people of Northeastern tribes, as both an official category used by the government and as a means to self-identify. 
- Main debate relating to the 'tribal question': whether tribes should be integrated into the mainstream or kept isolated.
	- Integrationist: G. S. Ghurye argued for assimilation within Hindu fold.
	- Isolationist: Verrier Elwin thought integration would be a threat to the culture of the tribes.
	- Both forgot to consider what the tribes actually want. 
- Marginalization of tribes due to loss of autonomy during colonial and post-colonial rule
	- Both sides of the debate forgot to account for this, leading to demands for autonomy on two levels.
	- Level one: autonomy within the Constitution (Jharkhand and Gondwana).
	- Level two: independence movements (Mizoram and Nagaland).
	- These movements started in order to protect tribal identity, culture, resources, land, etc.

- A common explanation for the rise of the calls for autonomy is the colonial isolation of tribes. 
	- Which is why most people are repelled by the idea of continued isolation, especially nationalists. 
	- Another is that a minority community (such as Christian converts) will gain too much power and revolt against the majority, and hence must be integrated into the national mainstream. 

- Experience of integration
	- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Othering\|Othering]] of tribes and Dalits due to political, social and cultural differences.
	- [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Dr B. R. Ambedkar\|Dr B. R. Ambedkar]] explains this process of the division of India into Puruskrut and Bahiskrut Bharat (pure and impure India).
	- "Mainstream" India is not defined, but attention is shifted away from that issue by framing the integration of the tribes as a 'problem', making them 'outsiders' who need to be included to inculcate national consciousness. 
- Aloysius' critique of Indian nationalism: created a State, not a nation since social differentiation still persisted, and did nothing for the oppressed masses. 
	- Dichotomy created: insiders (Hindus) forming the cultural core and outsiders (anyone else) who needs to be integrated.
	- The opinions of the majority insiders become 'nationalism' and everyone else's is seen as an outsider opinion until they identify with the majority.
	- Objective of national integration then becomes cultural homogeneity based on a shared national identity.
		- Pluralism becomes a threat to national unity. 
		- Political integration is not where the issue of national integration ends. 
 - Constant cartographic anxiety due to such diverse regions with different demands. 

Tribal futures and the Sixth schedule
- Introduced to woo tribes to join the Indian union and integrate them.
- Failed to protect their interests or rights, leading to demands for autonomy. 
- Central government can overrule individual state decisions (quasi-federal structure).
- Wanted protective regimes to safeguard their rights, not isolation or integration.
- Many communities aspire for the Sixth Schedule (Manipur).

Inclusion or Integration: Contestation and Challenges
- Excluded from the rest of the country, main cause for being unknown.
- Protests against racism and exclusion of the history of the Northeast regions.
