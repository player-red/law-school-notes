- If the social world were in equilibrium, the people (agents) would be interchangeable - however, this is not the case due to the existence of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Capital\|Capital]].
- Capital is accumulated labour, collected by agents who appropriate social energy.
	- freezing/saving time using someone else's labour: if someone else is doing chores, you have more time to do what you want. 
	- _Vis insita_ and _lex insita_: innate power and law (underlying society)
- Without the existence of capital, society would simply be a game of roulette, since nothing in the past would affect the present.
- Economic capital is not the only form of capital (==self-interested==): capitalism and the system of monetary exchange implicitly created a system of other forms of exchange (==disinterested==).
	- The economy of practices is an all-encompassing concept that includes both economic and non-economic forms of activities, exchanges and capital.
	- The masking of cultural and social capital is called euphemization. 
	- Transubstantiation of capital: conversion of economic/material capital to cultural and social capital.

The three types of capital:
1. Economic capital
2. Cultural capital
3. Social capital

(Cultural and social are disinterested/non-economic forms of capital.)

Cultural capital 
1. Embodied state
	- becomes a part of the person internally (habitus).
	- cannot be transmitted instantaneously.
	- transmitted to children during the socialization period, called the period of accumulation.
	- free time for this sort of education is obtained from the time freed up by domestic labour.
	- form of capital that is hidden in the best way, cannot be censored and controlled in ways that other forms of capital are.
	- functions as symbolic capital: unrecognized as capital and perceived as legitimate competence.
2. Objectified state: literal physical objects.
	- In order to use or consume these objects, the user must possess embodied cultural capital. 
3. Institutionalized state
	- embodied + objectified = same biological limits as bearer, cannot be transmitted.
	- eg: a certificate confirming competence. Someone who is self-taught and competent may be called into question, but someone with a recognized certificate will be revered.
	- This gives a guaranteed monetary value for the certificate holder's labour (eco. capital used to obtain cultural capital, and gives returns as eco. capital again).

- EX: Children from better socioeconomic backgrounds often perform better in school — correlation between not only economic capital but also cultural capital and academic performance.
	- Monetary investments: school fees, cash equivalent of time dedicated to study, etc.
	- However, people of different social classes invest different amounts of economic and cultural capital in education. 
	- Most well hidden educational investment: domestic transmission of cultural capital. 
	- =="Talent/ability"== is the result of investment of time (bought by economic capital) and cultural capital.

- LINK between economic and cultural capital: time needed to acquire cultural capital is acquired by using economic capital, a precondition for the accumulation of cultural capital. 

Social Capital
- Members of a group who collectively gain access to some sort of benefits.
- Institutionalized relationships create mutual acquaintance and recognition.
- Volume of social capital depends on the size of network and volume of capital possessed by each person in the network: how much can be mobilized by on individual. 
- Never independent of economic or cultural capital due to mutual acknowledgement of these two forms of capital.
- Exerts a multiplier effect on the capital of the individual.
- It is not necessary to personally know every individual in the network. 
- Investments of time create material and symbolic profits.
- Through the exchange of a woman, ([[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]], [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]]) two families are joined together. ([[Y1 T1 Society/READINGS/PRIMARY/SOC6.20 Palriwala & Kaur, Marrying in South Asia - Shifting Concepts, Changing Practices in a Globalizing World\|SOC6.20 Palriwala & Kaur, Marrying in South Asia - Shifting Concepts, Changing Practices in a Globalizing World]])

Conversions
- Economic capital is the root of all forms of capital
- Other forms of capital are hidden results of economic capital.
- Law of conservation of social energy: profits in one area = costs in another. 
- Everything that hides economic capital has a higher chance of producing loss.
	- EX: transmission of cultural capital may fail.
- Liquidity of commercial capital means it is not very long-lasting.
