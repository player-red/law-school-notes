- If the social world were in equilibrium, the people (agents) would be interchangeable - however, this is not the case due to the existence of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Capital\|Capital]].
- Capital is accumulated labour, collected by agents who appropriate social energy.
	- freezing/saving time using someone else's labour: if someone else is doing chores, you have more time to do what you want. 
	- _Vis insita_ and _lex insita_: innate power and law (underlying society)
- Without the existence of capital, society would simply be a game of roulette, since nothing in the past would affect the present.
- Economic capital is not the only form of capital (==self-interested==): capitalism and the system of monetary exchange implicitly created a system of other forms of exchange (==disinterested==).
	- The economy of practices is an all-encompassing concept that includes both economic and non-economic forms of activities, exchanges and capital.
	- The masking of cultural and social capital is called euphemization. 
	- Transubstantiation of capital: conversion of economic/material capital to cultural and social capital.

The three types of capital:
1. Economic capital
2. Cultural capital
3. Social capital

(Cultural and social are disinterested/non-economic forms of capital.)

Cultural capital 
1. Embodied state
	- becomes a part of the person internally (habitus).
	- cannot be transmitted instantaneously.
	- transmitted to children during the socialization period, called the period of accumulation.
	- free time for this sort of education is obtained from the time freed up by domestic labour.
	- form of capital that is hidden in the best way, cannot be censored and controlled in ways that other forms of capital are.
2. Objectified state
3. Institutionalized state
	- embodied + objectified = same biological limits as bearer, cannot be transmitted.
	- eg: a certificate confirming competence.
