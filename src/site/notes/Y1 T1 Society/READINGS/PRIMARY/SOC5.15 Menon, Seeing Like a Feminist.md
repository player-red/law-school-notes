Chapter 2: 'Body'
tags: #feminism, #gender, #patriarchy 


- Sex is often thought of as biological, but feminists challenge this notion, saying it is cultural as well.
- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]] is seen as cultural and social, due to the presence of gender roles that people are expected to follow under the heterosexual matrix.
- Individuation: Western idea that states that the 'individual' or 'I' stops at the boundaries of one's own skin. Spreading to post-colonial and other countries due to globalization. 
- Non-Western societies tend to believe that the individual is the intersection of the individuated bodies and collectivities. 

- Anne-Fausto Sterling: hermaphrodites punished for not choosing one established gender out of the binary only in 17th century Europe.
- Oyeronke Oyewumi: many west African societies are non-gender specific, the Yoruba language is gender-free (but wrongly translated to include gendered terms), non-body based identities like seniority are valued more in African society, unlike in Western society that values body-based identities.
- Ifi Amadiume: male and female roles can be assumed by anyone regardless of gender in Igbo society. 
- Native American society: 'two-spirit' people, women and men marrying people of the same sex - considered 3rd and 4th gender.
- Bhakti movement: desexualized the body, especially the female body. Stated that when the difference between male and female is exposed, people become indifferent to it. 
- Cross-dressing male actors: femininity became restructured by transvestite persons - women were told to act like them, not the other way around. 

- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Biological Determinism\|Biological Determinism]]: essential for feminists to differentiate between sex and gender, because women are considered fundamentally weaker due to the biological differences between men and women. 
- Child-rearing practices differentiate between the sexes and teach them to conform through punishment and reward.
- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]]: [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Simone de Beauvoir\|Simone de Beauvoir]] - "One is not born, rather becomes a woman."
- What is considered feminine and masculine constantly changes over time, ie coding of activities making them gendered.
- Fatima Mernissi: compared Imam Ghazali and Freud's writings - both considered female sexuality to be destructive to social order, Ghazali thought it was active, and Freud thought it was passive. 
- Human biology is affected by the body itself, the environment and the state of technology and development. 
	- Thus, human intervention changes the environment, and vice versa.
	- Occurs in two ways: long-term evolution, and short-term changes due to social factors.
	- thus, the human body has been shaped by 'culture' as much as the environment - there is not much of a difference between the female and male body.
	- Radical feminism: Underplaying biological differences would be devaluing women's role - the patriarchy undermined feminine qualities. 
	- Eco-feminism: countering the notion that women are akin to natural resources, ie natural resources until harnessed. Trying to reclaim the notion of the 'creative feminine' from patriarchy.

- Carol Gilligan: transfer of gender roles during childhood - women are usually primary caregivers, so boys 'differentiate' themselves from their mothers while girls 'identify' with their mothers - shaping their interactions with each other in society.
	- Women make more contextualized decisions based on empathy, sensitivity and concern while men use normative logic and rationality without context. Women seen as immature.
	- More prevalent in white communities.
	- For migrants, both men and women used context to make decisions.
	- South Asian supportive masculinity: men have control over their female family members due to a sense of responsibility and duties towards them
	- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Intersectionality\|Intersectionality]]: different identities converging. 

- [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Judith Butler\|Judith Butler]]: theory of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Performativity\|Performativity]] due to the influence of the [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Heterosexual Matrix\|Heterosexual Matrix]].

- Current understanding of male and female body: each are distinct with distinct primary and secondary sexual characteristics, anyone who is different is 'deviant/abnormal'.
	- Gynaecomastia (growing of breasts, affects 1/3rd men), hormonal inducing of lactation in both men and women.
	- Biomedical sciences treat the presence of male and female hormones together in one body as abnormal due to the gender binary.
	- Today, we use the gender binary, but the theory till the 18th century was that women were simply lesser versions of men. 
- Intersex people, by definition do not fit into the heterosexual matrix, so they are assigned a gender at birth, given surgeries and raised as a particular gender. 
	- They face a lot of discrimination and isolation due to their ambiguous gender identities.

Characteristics used to define biological sex
- Genetic/Chromosomal: XX, XY 
	- does not account for people with XXY, X0, etc.
- Hormonal: estrogen, testosterone
	- common for men and women to have both
- Genital: visible sexual reproductive organs

- The comparison of the egg and sperm to the perceptions of women and men - passive and active.
	- Recently challenged, because it was found that the egg actually draws the sperm towards itself and helps it stick due to its adhesive surface - perception of women as a danger to men's autonomy. 

- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Masculinity\|Masculinity]]: India used to have fluid gender identities before the advent of colonialism, which introduced a more rigid sense of masculinity.
	- Gandhi incorporated many elements of femininity in his politics.
	- Worship of the Mother Goddess in Hinduism creates a different kind of misogyny: two modes - dangerous (to be subdued) and defensive (desexualization of himself or of the woman).

- Main difference between the sexes: the way society is shaped, to advantage one sex, completely from the perspective of the man. 
	- Different identities cause different effects in our world (intersectionality).
	- If the world was designed around someone else, it would be vastly different. (example: a world structured around sightlessness & wheelchairs rather than sighted people.)
