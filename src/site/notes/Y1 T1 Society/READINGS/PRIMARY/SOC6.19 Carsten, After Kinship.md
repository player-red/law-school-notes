Two types of analyses of kinship:
- What is "natural" (biological)
- What is "cultural" (social)

Mid-twentieth century kinship

1. ==British social anthropology==: Bronislaw Malinowski, Meyer Fortes
	- They were trying to understand how small-scale societies functioned in the absence of government & state, and they saw kinship as having political structure & social continuity. 
	- Saw the nuclear family as a universal social institution.
	- Divided kinship into two parts: domestic and politico-jural.
	- Domestic: immediate nuclear families.
	- Politico-jural: lineage, inheritance, power, property, etc. politics and religion could not be separated from kinship. 
	- Assumed to be universally constant, ignored other types of habitation among families.
	- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]]: the roles women were expected to follow was socializing the children and domestic labour, therefore excluding them from anthropological accounts.

2. ==French structural approach==: Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss
	- Analysis of social rules by looking at their structural relation to each other.
	- Particularly examined the rules of marriageability, ie the near-universal prohibition of incest and its variations. This is called 'exogamy'.
	- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]] - it was the men exchanging the women like 'supreme gifts' to ensure the reproduction of the group. Not true for all cultures, according to feminist scholars.
	- He mainly studied in terms of fundamental oppositions, ie men vs women, culture vs nature, and so on. 
	- He shifted the focus of kinship studies from descent to marriage.
	- The idea of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Marriage\|Marriage]] as a long-term exchange between families involving the transfer of goods, services and people. 

- Both these types of study constantly debated over alliance and descent when it came to marriage, but both had extremely normative ways of thinking: very little room for family *structures* and *roles* (especially gender roles) beyond what they prescribed.
- When studying non-Western societies, they did not consider marriage as a defining feature of society, hence [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Othering\|Othering]] them. 
- [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]]'s critique of the anthropological study of kinship: one household seen as a unit of production, and property seen as the basis for all relations.
- The constant forces of death and separation meant people focused more on forgetting than remembering.

[[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/David Schneider\|David Schneider]]'s role:
- Reformulated the anthropology of kinship.
- Belonged to a tradition that saw kinship & culture like languages: by studying terminology used in a particular, one could reveal insights about the idea of kinship in that culture. 
	- Schneider specifically studied cultural meanings, i.e. the meaning of symbols and gestures rather than how groups functioned or compare literal linguistic terms.
	- This is called ==symbolic interactionism==. [[Y1 T1 Society/PEOPLE/Satish Deshpande\|Satish Deshpande]] talks about this in [[Y1 T1 Society/READINGS/PRIMARY/SOC1.03 Deshpande, Contemporary India - A Sociological View\|SOC1.03 Deshpande, Contemporary India - A Sociological View]], about Edmund Husserl's perspective of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]]: the sharing of social meaning using symbols, gestures, etc. 
- Part of the anthropological shift from function to meaning.
- He critiqued the relationship between biological and cultural aspects of kinships by challenging an assumption that European scholars held.
	- This assumption was that the main aspect of kinship was sexual procreation. 
- Critique of his work: never abandoned the dichotomy of biological and social kinship. 

Post-Schneider
- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]] inspired the study of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]], but gender cannot be understood without understanding marriage, [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Family\|Family]] structures, inheritance, beliefs about procreation, etc.
- Reproductive technologies created situations that were not possible before, giving rise to a new branch of study. 
	- New ideas of motherhood, fatherhood, how biological relations (or lack of) affect the connection between parents and children. 
- ==Marilyn Strathern's== ideas:
	- Nature is no longer something to "discover", since it can now be "produced" by technology.
	- The implicit assumptions of Western kinship, nature and culture need to be stated and made obvious in order to study them.
	- Kinship helps understand the relationship between nature and culture.
