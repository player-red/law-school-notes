Two types of analyses of kinship:
- What is "natural" (biological)
- What is "cultural" (social)

Mid-twentieth century kinship

1. ==British social anthropology==: Bronislaw Malinowski, Meyer Fortes
	- They were trying to understand how small-scale societies functioned in the absence of government & state, and they saw kinship as having political structure & social continuity. 
	- Saw the nuclear family as a universal social institution.
	- Divided kinship into two parts: domestic and politico-jural.
	- Domestic: immediate nuclear families.
	- Politico-jural: lineage, inheritance, power, property, etc. politics and religion could not be separated from kinship. 
	- Assumed to be universally constant, ignored other types of habitation among families.
	- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Gender\|Gender]]: the roles women were expected to follow was socializing the children and domestic labour, therefore excluding them from anthropological accounts.

2. French structural approach: Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss
	- Analysis of social rules by looking at their structural relation to each other.
	- Particularly examined the rules of marriageability, ie the near-universal prohibition of incest and its variations. This is called 'exogamy'.
	- [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Feminism\|Feminism]] - it was the men exchanging the women like 'supreme gifts' to ensure the reproduction of the group. Not true for all cultures, according to feminist scholars.
	- He mainly studied in terms of fundamental oppositions, ie men vs women, culture vs nature, and so on. 
	- He shifted the focus of kinship studies from descent to marriage.
	- The idea of [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Marriage\|Marriage]] as a long-term exchange between families involving the transfer of goods, services and people.
