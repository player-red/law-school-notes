Wrote [[Y1 T1 Society/READINGS/PRIMARY/SOC1.03 Deshpande, Contemporary India - A Sociological View\|SOC1.03 Deshpande, Contemporary India - A Sociological View]], covering [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Commonsense\|Commonsense]], modernity, globalization, [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Caste\|Caste]], middle class, etc. He explained the [[Y1 T1 Society/CONCEPTS/Paradox of Castelessness\|Paradox of Castelessness]] by talking about how upper-caste individuals converted their historic caste capital into modern capital by considering themselves casteless, and framed lower-caste individuals as the one perpetuating caste by demanding representation through reservations. 

Views of modernity and modernization:
- constantly explored through the lens of what is 'traditional' 
- extremely desirable (for non-Western countries colonized by Western countries), since colonial marks could be erased and they could feel equal to their former colonial masters.
- 'Tradition' and 'modernity' work in tandem: if one is present, another party is compensating.
	- If a man is 'modern', a woman may be 'traditional'
